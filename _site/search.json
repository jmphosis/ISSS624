These two sub-folders are within the data folder of the Hands-on_Ex1 folder.\n\n\n\nThe two R packages used in this hands-on exercises were:\n\nsf for importing, managing, and processing geospatial data, and\ntidyverse for performing data science tasks such as importing, wrangling and visualising data.\n\nThey were loaded into the R environment using the following code:\n\npacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse)\n\nThis allows installation and loading, without needing to take a two-step process using install.packages() and library().\n\n\n\nThe st_read() (under sf) was used to import the three geospatial data sets:\n\nMP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL, a polygon feature layer in ESRI shapefile format;\nCyclingPath, a line feature layer in ESRI shapefile format; and\nPreSchool, a point feature layer in kml file format."
