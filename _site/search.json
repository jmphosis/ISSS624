The LTA DataMall shares some of these data publicly, which helps to speed up the development of practical solutions to enhance reliability and efficiency of the transport system by other stakeholders, such as the private sector and individuals.\nThe data sets used in this take-home exercise are:\n\nPassenger Volume by Origin Destination Bus Stops from the LTA DataMall for the period of August 2023 to October 2023. There are three aspatial data sets (one for each month) in csv format. It contains data on the number of trips by weekdays and weekends from origin to destination bus stops.\nBus Stop Location from the LTA DataMall. This is a geospatial data set in ESRI shapefile format. It contains a point representation that indicates the position of each bus stop where buses stop to pick up or drop off passengers.\n\nThe data sets are placed under two sub-folders:\n\ngeospatial (Bus Stop Location), and\naspatial (Passenger Volume by Origin Destination Bus Stops).\n\nThese two sub-folders are within the data folder of my Take-home_Ex1 folder."

    "text": "3 Data Wrangling\n\n3.1 Preparing the Aspatial Data - Passenger Volume\n\n3.1.1 Importing and Merging Data\nThe three csv files are imported and combined into a tibble data frame, odbus, using functions from the base package as shown in the following codes:\n\nGenerate list of file names of csv files using the list.files() function in the base package.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nfilenames = list.files(path=\"data/aspatial/\", pattern=\"*.csv\")\n\nfilenames\n\n\n[1] \"origin_destination_bus_202308.csv\" \"origin_destination_bus_202309.csv\"\n[3] \"origin_destination_bus_202310.csv\"\n\n\n\nGenerate path to csv files using the file.path() function in the base package.\n\n\n\nShow the code\npath = file.path(\"data/aspatial\", filenames)\n\npath\n\n\n[1] \"data/aspatial/origin_destination_bus_202308.csv\"\n[2] \"data/aspatial/origin_destination_bus_202309.csv\"\n[3] \"data/aspatial/origin_destination_bus_202310.csv\"\n\n\n\nMerge the three csv files using the do.call() and lapply() functions in the base package and the read.csv() function from the readr package.\n\n\nodbus = do.call(\"rbind\", lapply(path, FUN=function(files){ read.csv(files)}))\n\n\nCheck using the unique() function in the base package to confirm that the data sets for each of the three months have been incorporated. [Note: Although the three data sets have been merged into a single data frame, the observations would be analysed month by month, instead of aggregating all observations.]\n\n\n\nShow the code\nunique(odbus$YEAR_MONTH)\n\n\n[1] \"2023-08\" \"2023-09\" \"2023-10\"\n\n\nOnce the combined data set has been obtained, the n_distinct() function in the dplyr package and the sum() function in the base package are applied to uncover the following observations regarding odbus:\n\nOverall, there are 17,118,005 rows (observations) and 7 columns. 5,709,512, 5,714,196, and 5,694,297 rows (observations) from August, September, and October 2023 respectively, reflecting a generally stable total ridership over the three-month period.\nThe “YEAR_MONTH” column has three unique values, reflecting the observations from August, September, and October 2023.\nThe “DAY_TYPE” column has two unique values, reflecting observations from weekday or weekends/holiday.\nThe “TIME_PER_HOUR” has 24 unique values, reflecting that the observations are broken down into each of the 24 hours of a day.\nThe “PT_TYPE” column refers only has the value of “BUS” as the public transport type. Hence, it may be dropped.\nThe “ORIGIN_PT_CODE” and “DESTINATION_PT_CODE” columns have 5,075 and 5,079 unique values respectively, reflecting the number of bus stops with bus routes passing through them.\nThe “TOTAL_TRIPS” column contains values that reflect the number of passengers for each unique month, type of day, origin bus stop, destination bus stop. The minimum value is 1, i.e., there are no rows with zero values.\n\n\nsapply(odbus, function(x) n_distinct(x))\n\n         YEAR_MONTH            DAY_TYPE       TIME_PER_HOUR             PT_TYPE \n                  3                   2                  24                   1 \n     ORIGIN_PT_CODE DESTINATION_PT_CODE         TOTAL_TRIPS \n               5075                5079                4854 \n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nsum(odbus$YEAR_MONTH == \"2023-08\")\n\n\n[1] 5709512\n\n\nShow the code\nsum(odbus$YEAR_MONTH == \"2023-09\")\n\n\n[1] 5714196\n\n\nShow the code\nsum(odbus$YEAR_MONTH == \"2023-10\")\n\n\n[1] 5694297\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Checking for Duplicates and Missing Values\nThe data sets from the LTA DataMall are expected to be relatively clean. Nevertheless, due diligence checks for duplicates and missing values are still made to confirm the assumptions.\nThe duplicated() function in the base package is used to check for duplicates in odbus. There are no duplicates in the tibble data frame.\n\nodbus[duplicated(odbus), ]\n\n[1] YEAR_MONTH          DAY_TYPE            TIME_PER_HOUR      \n[4] PT_TYPE             ORIGIN_PT_CODE      DESTINATION_PT_CODE\n[7] TOTAL_TRIPS        \n&lt;0 rows&gt; (or 0-length row.names)\n\n\nThe colSums() function in the base package is used to check for missing values in odbus.

The output is a simple feature data frame, busstop, which is in the SVY21 projected coordinates systems. It has 5,161 features and 3 fields, which include the geometry points indicating the bus stop locations.\n\nbusstop = st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\",\n                  layer = \"BusStop\")\n\nReading layer `BusStop' from data source \n  `C:\\jmphosis\\ISSS624\\Take-home_Ex\\Take-home_Ex1\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 5161 features and 3 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 3970.122 ymin: 26482.1 xmax: 48284.56 ymax: 52983.82\nProjected CRS: SVY21\n\n\n\nglimpse(busstop)\n\nRows: 5,161\nColumns: 4\n$ BUS_STOP_N &lt;chr&gt; \"22069\", \"32071\", \"44331\", \"96081\", \"11561\", \"66191\", \"2338…\n$ BUS_ROOF_N &lt;chr&gt; \"B06\", \"B23\", \"B01\", \"B05\", \"B05\", \"B03\", \"B02A\", \"B02\", \"B…\n$ LOC_DESC   &lt;chr&gt; \"OPP CEVA LOGISTICS\", \"AFT TRACK 13\", \"BLK 239\", \"GRACE IND…\n$ geometry   &lt;POINT [m]&gt; POINT (13576.31 32883.65), POINT (13228.59 44206.38),…\n\n\nThe st_crs() function in the sf package is then used to check the coordinate system of the busstop simple feature data frame. The output shows that although it is projected in SVY21, the EPSG is indicated as 9001, which is incorrect given that it should be 3414 instead.\n\nst_crs(busstop)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: SVY21 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"SVY21\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"WGS 84\",\n        DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",6326]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]]],\n    CONVERSION[\"unnamed\",\n        METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",1.36666666666667,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",103.833333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",1,\n            SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False easting\",28001.642,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False northing\",38744.572,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"(E)\",east,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1,\n                ID[\"EPSG\",9001]]],\n        AXIS[\"(N)\",north,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1,\n                ID[\"EPSG\",9001]]]]\n\n\nTo correct the EPSG, the st_set_crs() function in the sf package is applied.

Nevertheless, due diligence checks for duplicates and missing values are still made to confirm the assumptions.\nThe duplicated() function in the base package and st_geometry() function in the sf package are used to check for duplicates in busstop. The output returned Bus Stop No. 96319 at row 3265. On closer inspection of the simple feature data frame, rows 3264 and 3265 are found to be duplicates. Hence, the row 3264 is removed using the row_number() function in the dplyr package. The same check is conducted again to confirm that there are no more duplicates.\n\nbusstop[duplicated(st_geometry(busstop)), ]\n\nSimple feature collection with 1 feature and 3 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 42187.23 ymin: 34995.78 xmax: 42187.23 ymax: 34995.78\nProjected CRS: SVY21 / Singapore TM\n     BUS_STOP_N BUS_ROOF_N        LOC_DESC                  geometry\n3265      96319        NIL YUSEN LOGISTICS POINT (42187.23 34995.78)\n\n\n\nbusstop = busstop %&gt;%\n  filter(row_number() != 3264)\n\nbusstop[duplicated(st_geometry(busstop)), ]\n\nSimple feature collection with 0 features and 3 fields\nBounding box:  xmin: NA ymin: NA xmax: NA ymax: NA\nProjected CRS: SVY21 / Singapore TM\n[1] BUS_STOP_N BUS_ROOF_N LOC_DESC   geometry  \n&lt;0 rows&gt; (or 0-length row.names)\n\n\nThe colSums() function in the base package is used to check for missing values in busstop. There are no missing values in the simple feature data frame, busstop for all columns except “LOC_DESC”. On closer inspection, there are several bus stops without descriptions but they are retained because they have “BUS_STOP_N” values.\n\ncolSums(is.na(busstop))\n\nBUS_STOP_N BUS_ROOF_N   LOC_DESC   geometry \n         0          0          8          0 \n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Selecting Columns and Removing Bus Stops in Malaysia\nThe select() function in dplyr package is used to drop the “BUS_ROOF_N” column in busstop since it is not required. As there are bus stops situated in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, they are removed using the filter() function in the dplyr package.\n\nbusstop = busstop %&gt;%\n  select(-BUS_ROOF_N) %&gt;% \n  filter(LOC_DESC != \"JOHOR BAHRU CHECKPT\" & LOC_DESC != \"LARKIN TER\")\n\nThe output is saved in rds file format and imported into the R environment.\n\n\nShow the code\nwrite_rds(busstop, \"data/rds/busstop.rds\")\nbusstop = read_rds(\"data/rds/busstop.rds\")\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Performing Relational Join\nThe simple feature data frame, busstop, and the tibble data frame, odbus, are combined using the left_join() function in the dplyr package, by matching the “BUS_STOP_N” column in busstop with the “ORIGIN_PT_CODE” in odbus. However, as the “BUS_STOP_N” values are character values, they would need to be converted to integer values first before the join, so that values such as “01012” in busstop can be matched to values such as “1012” in odbus.\nUpon joining the two data frames, the output is the simple feature data frame (since busstop was placed as the first argument in the left_join() function), bus. The number of rows (observations), based on odbus, was reduced from 7,903,394 to 7,848,515. This is likely because some newer bus stops such as Bus Stop No. 3549 (Shenton Way Stn Exit 3) and Bus Stop No. 96461 (Bef Aviation Pk Rd) were not included in the Bus Stop Location shapefile that was last updated in July 2023. This means that the analysis in this take-home exercise is limited in this aspect.\n\nbusstop = busstop %&gt;%\n  mutate(BUS_STOP_N = as.integer(BUS_STOP_N))\n\nbus = left_join(busstop, odbus, \n                by = c(\"BUS_STOP_N\" = \"ORIGIN_PT_CODE\"))\n\nThe output is saved in rds file format and imported into the R environment.\n\n\nShow the code\nwrite_rds(bus, \"data/rds/bus.rds\")\nbus = read_rds(\"data/rds/bus.rds\")\n\nrm(odbus, busstop)\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Creating Spatial Hexagon Grid\nSpatial grids are commonly used in spatial analysis. Regularly shaped grids may comprise of equilateral triangles, squares, or hexagons. The hexagon is the most circular-shaped polygon that can tessellate to form an evenly spaced grid, providing a low perimeter-to-area ratio that reduces sampling bias due to edge effects of the grid shape.\nA more circular polygon means that points near the border are closer to the centroid. Hexagons are often used when the analysis involves aspects of connectivity or movement paths. Locating neighbours is simpler using a hexagon grid because the contact edge or length is consistent on each side, resulting in equidistant centroids for each neighbour.\nA spatial hexagon grid, hgrid, for the study area of Singapore is created using the following codes:\n\ngeo = st_make_grid(bus, c(500, 500), what = \"polygons\", square = FALSE)\n\nhgrid = st_sf(geo) %&gt;%\n  mutate(grid_id = 1:length(lengths(geo)))"

For illustration purposes, three common types of inputs for the “style” argument and custom breaks are tried out below for Aug 2023 weekday morning peak period.\n\nstyle = “quantile” - the number of categories is taken from the “n” argument, which has a default value of 5.\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(wdAMAug_ct) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\",\n    palette = \"Reds\",\n    style = \"quantile\",\n    title = \"No. of Passenger Trips\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.5,\n    popup.vars = c(\"No. of Passenger Trips: \" = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\"),\n    popup.format = list(TOTAL_TRIPS = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0))) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Weekday Morning Peak in Aug 2023: style = quantile\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstyle = “jenks” - this produces a map based on natural breaks.\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(wdAMAug_ct) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\",\n    palette = \"Reds\",\n    style = \"jenks\",\n    title = \"No. of Passenger Trips\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.5,\n    popup.vars = c(\"No. of Passenger Trips: \" = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\"),\n    popup.format = list(TOTAL_TRIPS = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0))) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Weekday Morning Peak in Aug 2023: style = jenks\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstyle = “equal” - which produces a map with equal intervals for each category.\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(wdAMAug_ct) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\",\n    palette = \"Reds\",\n    style = \"equal\",\n    title = \"No. of Passenger Trips\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.5,\n    popup.vars = c(\"No. of Passenger Trips: \" = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\"),\n    popup.format = list(TOTAL_TRIPS = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0))) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Weekday Morning Peak in Aug 2023: style = equal\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom breaks set at fixed intervals of 100,000 passengers.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nbrk = c(1, 100000, 200000, 300000, 400000, 500000, 600000)\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(wdAMAug_ct) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\",\n    palette = \"Reds\",\n    breaks = brk,\n    title = \"No. of Passenger Trips\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.5,\n    popup.vars = c(\"No. of Passenger Trips: \" = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\"),\n    popup.format = list(TOTAL_TRIPS = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0))) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Weekday Morning Peak in Aug 2023: custom breaks\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Weekday Morning Peak (6am to 9.59am)\nThe custom breaks approach for mapping the passenger trips by origin bus stops are used for descriptive analysis.\nThe plots from the three months for the weekday morning peak period are visualised using functions from the tmap package:\n\nAug 2023Sep 2023Oct 2023\n\n\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntm_shape(wdAMAug_ct) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\",\n    palette = \"Reds\",\n    breaks = brk,\n    title = \"No. of Passenger Trips\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.5,\n    popup.vars = c(\"No. of Passenger Trips: \" = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\"),\n    popup.format = list(TOTAL_TRIPS = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0))) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Weekday Morning Peak in Aug 2023\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntm_shape(wdAMSep_ct) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\",\n    palette = \"Reds\",\n    breaks = brk,\n    title = \"No. of Passenger Trips\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.5,\n    popup.vars = c(\"No. of Passenger Trips: \" = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\"),\n    popup.format = list(TOTAL_TRIPS = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0))) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Weekday Morning Peak in Sep 2023\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntm_shape(wdAMOct_ct) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\",\n    palette = \"Reds\",\n    breaks = brk,\n    title = \"No. of Passenger Trips\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.5,\n    popup.vars = c(\"No. of Passenger Trips: \" = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\"),\n    popup.format = list(TOTAL_TRIPS = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0))) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Weekday Morning Peak in Oct 2023\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe passenger trips by origin bus stops for the weekday morning peak period shows that the largest numbers of passenger trips originate from bus interchanges in the heartland areas, namely:\n\nWest: Boon Lay Bus Interchange (409,412 passenger trips in Aug 2023; Grid ID: 1251) and Clementi Bus Interchange (202,467 passenger trips in Aug 2023; Grid ID: 2054).\nNorth: Woodlands Bus Interchange (313,192 passenger trips in Aug 2023; Grid ID: 2411).\nCentral: Ang Mo Kio Bus Interchange (212,340 passenger trips in Aug 2023; Grid ID: 3239).\nEast: Tampines Bus Interchange (202,366 passenger trips in Aug 2023; Grid ID: 4539).\n\nThe only non-bus interchange bus stop is the one in the north-east region at “After Punggol Road” leading to Tampines Expressway (TPE), with 207,583 passenger trips in Aug 2023. This is possibly due to the large number of commuters heading to work at Changi Airport in the east.\nThe above observation underscores the importance of bus interchanges in the weekday morning peak period as major transportation hubs for commuters to get to work. This is given that they are the first bus stop for a large number of bus routes. This provides useful information for urban planners and transport authorities in that they could examine whether the existing bus interchanges need to be expanded or improved to accommodate such high demands.\n\n\n4.4 Weekday Afternoon Peak (5pm to 8.59pm)\nThe plots from the three months for the weekday afternoon peak period are visualised using functions from the tmap package:\n\nAug 2023Sep 2023Oct 2023\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntm_shape(wdPMAug_ct) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\",\n    palette = \"Reds\",\n    breaks = brk,\n    title = \"No. of Passenger Trips\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.5,\n    popup.vars = c(\"No. of Passenger Trips: \" = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\"),\n    popup.format = list(TOTAL_TRIPS = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0))) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Weekday Afternoon Peak in Aug 2023\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntm_shape(wdPMSep_ct) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\",\n    palette = \"Reds\",\n    breaks = brk,\n    title = \"No. of Passenger Trips\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.5,\n    popup.vars = c(\"No. of Passenger Trips: \" = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\"),\n    popup.format = list(TOTAL_TRIPS = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0))) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Weekday Afternoon Peak in Sep 2023\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntm_shape(wdPMOct_ct) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\",\n    palette = \"Reds\",\n    breaks = brk,\n    title = \"No. of Passenger Trips\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.5,\n    popup.vars = c(\"No. of Passenger Trips: \" = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\"),\n    popup.format = list(TOTAL_TRIPS = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0))) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Weekday Afternoon Peak in Oct 2023\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe passenger trips by origin bus stops for the weekday afternoon peak period also shows that the largest numbers of passenger trips originate from bus interchanges in the heartland areas, namely:\n\nWest: Boon Lay Bus Interchange (554,436 passenger trips in Aug 2023).\nNorth: Woodlands Bus Interchange (474,311 passenger trips in Aug 2023).\nCentral: Ang Mo Kio Bus Interchange (325,858 passenger trips in Aug 2023).\nEast: Tampines Bus Interchange (446,207 passenger trips in Aug 2023).\n\nAgain, the above observation underscores the importance of bus interchanges in the weekday afternoon peak period as major transportation hubs for commuters to get home from work. This is likely because of commuters returning from work who take buses from these bus interchanges which are beside MRT stations, i.e., the different bus routes are like the spoke of a bicycle wheel, with the MRT station as the hub. This provides useful information for urban planners and transport authorities in that they could examine whether the existing bus interchanges need to be expanded or improved to accommodate such high demands.\nThe observation could also reflect that these various towns are not just heartland areas where people live but are economic hubs with offices nearby where people work. This indicates that the Government’s efforts to decentralise economic activities away may have some effect.\n\n\n4.5 Weekend/Holiday Morning Peak (11am to 2.59pm)\nThe plots from the three months for the weekend/holiday morning peak period are visualised using functions from the tmap package:\n\nAug 2023Sep 2023Oct 2023\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntm_shape(weAMAug_ct) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\",\n    palette = \"Reds\",\n    breaks = brk,\n    title = \"No. of Passenger Trips\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.5,\n    popup.vars = c(\"No. of Passenger Trips: \" = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\"),\n    popup.format = list(TOTAL_TRIPS = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0))) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Weekend/Holiday Morning Peak in Aug 2023\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntm_shape(weAMSep_ct) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\",\n    palette = \"Reds\",\n    breaks = brk,\n    title = \"No. of Passenger Trips\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.5,\n    popup.vars = c(\"No. of Passenger Trips: \" = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\"),\n    popup.format = list(TOTAL_TRIPS = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0))) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Weekend/Holiday Morning Peak in Sep 2023\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntm_shape(weAMOct_ct) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\",\n    palette = \"Reds\",\n    breaks = brk,\n    title = \"No. of Passenger Trips\",\n    id = \"grid_id\",\n    showNA = FALSE,\n    alpha = 0.5,\n    popup.vars = c(\"No. of Passenger Trips: \" = \"TOTAL_TRIPS\"),\n    popup.format = list(TOTAL_TRIPS = list(format = \"f\", digits = 0))) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey40\", lwd = 0.7) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Weekend/Holiday Morning Peak in Oct 2023\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe passenger trips by origin bus stops for the weekend/holiday morning peak period shows that the numbers are generally lower. The bus stops (which are interchanges) with the highest numbers of passenger trips are:\n\nWest: Boon Lay Bus Interchange (121,029 passenger trips in Sep 2023).\nNorth: Woodlands Bus Interchange (108,572 passenger trips in Sep 2023).\nEast: Bedok Bus Interchange (111,194 passenger trips in Sep 2023) and Tampines Bus Interchange (107,719 passenger trips in Sep 2023).\n\nThis shows that the bus interchanges in the north, east and west play a very important role in serving as origin hubs for commuters who may be heading to the town area (or other areas in Singapore) to enjoy their time off. This also indicates that these towns are likely to have large populations.\nThe overall lower numbers on the weekend/holiday, even during the morning peak period shows that bus deployment can be kept relatively lean.

This could mean that more commuters head home in that 4-hour afternoon peak period as compared to the morning peak period.

    "text": "5 Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) Analysis\nLocal Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) are statistics that evaluate the existence of clusters in the spatial arrangement of a given variable. The appropriate LISA, including local Moran’s I, are applied to detect cluster(s) and/or outlier(s) for the Bus Passenger Trips in the bus simple feature data frame, month by month.\n\n5.1 Computing Distance-based Weights\nDistance-based weights are used in this take-home exercise. Distance-based weights are more appropriate than contiguity spatial weights in this context given that the hexagons are spread out across Singapore, and some hexagons may not have immediate neighbours (i.e., contiguous) due to reasons such as being separated by reservoirs or waterways.\nThere are three popularly used distance-based spatial weights, they are: fixed distance weights, adaptive distance weights, and inverse distance weights (IDW). For this take-home exercise, a combination of IDW and adaptive distance weights are used. IDW assigns higher weights to neighbours that are closer and lower weights to neighbours that are further away, while adaptive distance weights balances out the number of neighbours for each hexagon regardless of how densely populated its surrounding areas is (i.e., density of nearby bus stops).\n\nThe st_knn() function in the sfdep package is used to identify neighbors based on k (i.e. k = 8 indicates the nearest eight neighbours). The output is a list of neighbours (i.e. nb).\nThe st_inverse_distance() function in the sfdep package is then used to calculate inverse distance weights of neighbours in the nb.\n\n\nwdAMAug_wt = wdAMAug_ct %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb = st_knn(geo,\n                     k=8),\n         wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, \n                                   geo, \n                                   scale = 1, \n                                   alpha = 1), \n         .before = 1)\n\n\n\nShow the code for other subsets\nwdPMAug_wt = wdPMAug_ct %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb = st_knn(geo,\n                     k=8),\n         wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, \n                                   geo, \n                                   scale = 1, \n                                   alpha = 1), \n         .before = 1)\n\nweAMAug_wt = weAMAug_ct %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb = st_knn(geo,\n                     k=8),\n         wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, \n                                   geo, \n                                   scale = 1, \n                                   alpha = 1), \n         .before = 1)\n\nwePMAug_wt = wePMAug_ct %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb = st_knn(geo,\n                     k=8),\n         wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, \n                                   geo, \n                                   scale = 1, \n                                   alpha = 1), \n         .before = 1)\n\nwdAMSep_wt = wdAMSep_ct %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb = st_knn(geo,\n                     k=8),\n         wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, \n                                   geo, \n                                   scale = 1, \n                                   alpha = 1), \n         .before = 1)\n\nwdPMSep_wt = wdPMSep_ct %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb = st_knn(geo,\n                     k=8),\n         wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, \n                                   geo, \n                                   scale = 1, \n                                   alpha = 1), \n         .before = 1)\n\nweAMSep_wt = weAMSep_ct %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb = st_knn(geo,\n                     k=8),\n         wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, \n                                   geo, \n                                   scale = 1, \n                                   alpha = 1), \n         .before = 1)\n\nwePMSep_wt = wePMSep_ct %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb = st_knn(geo,\n                     k=8),\n         wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, \n                                   geo, \n                                   scale = 1, \n                                   alpha = 1), \n         .before = 1)\n\nwdAMOct_wt = wdAMOct_ct %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb = st_knn(geo,\n                     k=8),\n         wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, \n                                   geo, \n                                   scale = 1, \n                                   alpha = 1), \n         .before = 1)\n\nwdPMOct_wt = wdPMOct_ct %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb = st_knn(geo,\n                     k=8),\n         wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, \n                                   geo, \n                                   scale = 1, \n                                   alpha = 1), \n         .before = 1)\n\nweAMOct_wt = weAMOct_ct %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb = st_knn(geo,\n                     k=8),\n         wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, \n                                   geo, \n                                   scale = 1, \n                                   alpha = 1), \n         .before = 1)\n\nwePMOct_wt = wePMOct_ct %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb = st_knn(geo,\n                     k=8),\n         wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, \n                                   geo, \n                                   scale = 1, \n                                   alpha = 1), \n         .before = 1)\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Computing Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) of Passenger Trips by Origin\nThe local_moran() function in the sfdep package is used to compute the local Moran’s I value of “TOTAL_TRIPS” at the hexagon level.

This could also mean that there are no other bus stops in the area that is sharing the load of passenger trips with the bus interchange.\nOverall, the presence of the hexagons with high-high values and low-high values highlights the congested and non-congested areas in these various towns and provides useful information for urban planners and transport authorities in that they could examine whether the bus stops around these bus interchanges need to be expanded or improved to accommodate such high demands, and divert human traffic away from the bus interchanges during the weekend/holiday morning peak period.\nSeparately, the hexagons with statistically significant low-low values in the west, north, and east regions reflect that these areas are unlikely to have congestion problems during the weekend/holiday morning peak period.

    "text": "6 Conclusion\nThe take-home exercise has highlighted the bus commuting patterns of Singapore commuters for the four different peak periods, based on number of passenger trips from the origin bus stops. Overall, the LISA maps have highlighted the key problem areas for urban planners and transport authorities to focus their attention on. The analyses in this take-home exercise is limited in that it does not analyse MRT commuter patterns (which is another major public transport mode) alongside bus commuter patterns given that commuters often take a combination of these two transport modes in a single journey. Hence, some of the observations made throughout the take-home exercise cannot be ascertained more accurately and the statistically significant clusters highlighted should be further studied.\n~~~ End of Take-home Exercise 1 ~~~"

    "text": "Spatial Interaction Models (SIMs) are mathematical models for estimating flows between spatial entities. They were developed by Alan Wilson in the late 1960s and early 1970, with considerable uptake and refinement for transport modelling since then (Boyce and Williams, 2015).\nThere are four main types of traditional SIMs (Wilson 1971):\n\nUnconstrained\nProduction-constrained\nAttraction-constrained\nDoubly-constrained\n\nOrdinary least square (OLS), log-normal, Poisson and negative binomial (NB) regression methods have been used extensively to calibrate OD flow models by processing flow data as different types of dependent variables.\nIn this in-class exercise, the appropriate R packages are used to calibrate SIM by using there four regression methods.\nNote: Calibration is the process of adjusting parameters in the model to try and get the estimates to agree with the observed data as much as possible. Adjusting the parameters is the sort of iterative process that computers are particularly good at and the goodness-of-fit statistics can be used to indicate when the optimum solution is found. Historically, this process required a researcher with the requisite programming skills to write a computer algorithm to iteratively adjust each parameter, check the goodness-of-fit, and then start all over again until the goodness-of-fit statistic was maximised or minimised (Adam Dennett, 2018).\n\n\n\nIn this in-class exercise, a SIM is calibrated to determine the factors affecting the public bus passenger flows during the morning peak in Singapore.\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the following R packages are used:\n\nsf for importing, integrating, processing and transforming geospatial data;\ntidyverse for importing, integrating, wrangling and visualising data;\ntmap for creating thematic maps;\nsp for handling spatial data in computationally efficient ways;\nperformance for computing measures to assess model quality;\nreshape2 for handling matrix format; and\nggpubr for publication ready plots.\n\n\npacman::p_load(tmap, sf, sp,\n               performance, reshape2,\n               ggpubr, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nThis exercise is a continuation of Chapter 15: Processing and Visualising Flow Data and the following data will be used:\n\nod_data.rds: weekday morning peak passenger flows at planning subzone level.\nmpsz.rds: URA Master Plan 2019 Planning Subzone boundary in simple feature tibble data frame format.\n\nBesides these two data sets, an additional attribute data file called pop.csv will be used.\n\n\n\nIn spatial interaction, a distance matrix is a table that shows the distance between pairs of locations. For example, in the table below we can see an Euclidean distance of 3926.0025 between MESZ01 and RVSZ05, of 3939.1079 between MESZ01 and SRSZ01, and so on. By definition, an location’s distance from itself, which is shown in the main diagonal of the table, is 0.\nIn this section,a distance matrix is computed by using the mpsz, which is first imported as a sf tibble dataframe object class.\n\nmpsz = read_rds(\"data/rds/mpsz.rds\")\nmpsz\n\nSimple feature collection with 332 features and 6 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2667.538 ymin: 15748.72 xmax: 56396.44 ymax: 50256.33\nProjected CRS: SVY21 / Singapore TM\nFirst 10 features:\n                 SUBZONE_N SUBZONE_C       PLN_AREA_N PLN_AREA_C       REGION_N\n1              MARINA EAST    MESZ01      MARINA EAST         ME CENTRAL REGION\n2         INSTITUTION HILL    RVSZ05     RIVER VALLEY         RV CENTRAL REGION\n3           ROBERTSON QUAY    SRSZ01  SINGAPORE RIVER         SR CENTRAL REGION\n4  JURONG ISLAND AND BUKOM    WISZ01  WESTERN ISLANDS         WI    WEST REGION\n5             FORT CANNING    MUSZ02           MUSEUM         MU CENTRAL REGION\n6         MARINA EAST (MP)    MPSZ05    MARINE PARADE         MP CENTRAL REGION\n7                   SUDONG    WISZ03  WESTERN ISLANDS         WI    WEST REGION\n8                  SEMAKAU    WISZ02  WESTERN ISLANDS         WI    WEST REGION\n9           SOUTHERN GROUP    SISZ02 SOUTHERN ISLANDS         SI CENTRAL REGION\n10                 SENTOSA    SISZ01 SOUTHERN ISLANDS         SI CENTRAL REGION\n   REGION_C                       geometry\n1        CR MULTIPOLYGON (((33222.98 29...\n2        CR MULTIPOLYGON (((28481.45 30...\n3        CR MULTIPOLYGON (((28087.34 30...\n4        WR MULTIPOLYGON (((14557.7 304...\n5        CR MULTIPOLYGON (((29542.53 31...\n6        CR MULTIPOLYGON (((35279.55 30...\n7        WR MULTIPOLYGON (((15772.59 21...\n8        WR MULTIPOLYGON (((19843.41 21...\n9        CR MULTIPOLYGON (((30870.53 22...\n10       CR MULTIPOLYGON (((26879.04 26...\n\n\n\n\nThere are at least two ways to compute the required distance matrix. One is based on sf and the other is based on sp. Past experience shown that computing distance matrix by using sf function took a relatively longer time than the sp method, especially when the data set is large. In view of this, the sp method is used in the code chunks below.\nThe as() function with “Class” argument set as “Spatial” is used to convert mpsz from sf tibble data frame to SpatialPolygonsDataFrame of sp object\n\nStudent Note: For SpatialPolygonsDataFrame, in order to select a variable within a data.frame within the object, we will need to use something like mpsz@data$var_name.\n\n\nmpsz_sp = as(mpsz, \"Spatial\")\nmpsz_sp\n\nclass       : SpatialPolygonsDataFrame \nfeatures    : 332 \nextent      : 2667.538, 56396.44, 15748.72, 50256.33  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncrs         : +proj=tmerc +lat_0=1.36666666666667 +lon_0=103.833333333333 +k=1 +x_0=28001.642 +y_0=38744.572 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs \nvariables   : 6\nnames       : SUBZONE_N, SUBZONE_C, PLN_AREA_N, PLN_AREA_C,       REGION_N, REGION_C \nmin values  : ADMIRALTY,    AMSZ01, ANG MO KIO,         AM, CENTRAL REGION,       CR \nmax values  :    YUNNAN,    YSSZ09,     YISHUN,         YS,    WEST REGION,       WR \n\n\n\n\n\nThe spDists() function in the sp package is used to compute the Euclidean distance between the centroids of the planning subzones.\n\nStudent Note: Calculating the distance between centroids is computationally less intensive compared to more detailed spatial analyses. However, using centroid-to-centroid distance is a simplification and may not always capture the full complexity of spatial relationships.\n\nNotice that the output dist is a matrix object class of R. Also, notice that the column headers and row headers are not labeled with the planning subzone codes.\n\nStudent Note:\n\nIf longlat = TRUE, longitude and latitude are used to calculate the distance.\ndist is a matrix 332 by 332 (based on 332 observations from mpsz).\n\n\n\ndist = spDists(mpsz_sp, \n                longlat = FALSE)\nhead(dist, n=c(10, 10))\n\n           [,1]       [,2]      [,3]      [,4]       [,5]      [,6]      [,7]\n [1,]     0.000  3926.0025  3939.108 20252.964  2989.9839  1431.330 19211.836\n [2,]  3926.003     0.0000   305.737 16513.865   951.8314  5254.066 16242.523\n [3,]  3939.108   305.7370     0.000 16412.062  1045.9088  5299.849 16026.146\n [4,] 20252.964 16513.8648 16412.062     0.000 17450.3044 21665.795  7229.017\n [5,]  2989.984   951.8314  1045.909 17450.304     0.0000  4303.232 17020.916\n [6,]  1431.330  5254.0664  5299.849 21665.795  4303.2323     0.000 20617.082\n [7,] 19211.836 16242.5230 16026.146  7229.017 17020.9161 20617.082     0.000\n [8,] 14960.942 12749.4101 12477.871 11284.279 13336.0421 16281.453  5606.082\n [9,]  7515.256  7934.8082  7649.776 18427.503  7801.6163  8403.896 14810.930\n[10,]  6391.342  4975.0021  4669.295 15469.566  5226.8731  7707.091 13111.391\n           [,8]      [,9]     [,10]\n [1,] 14960.942  7515.256  6391.342\n [2,] 12749.410  7934.808  4975.002\n [3,] 12477.871  7649.776  4669.295\n [4,] 11284.279 18427.503 15469.566\n [5,] 13336.042  7801.616  5226.873\n [6,] 16281.453  8403.896  7707.091\n [7,]  5606.082 14810.930 13111.391\n [8,]     0.000  9472.024  8575.490\n [9,]  9472.024     0.000  3780.800\n[10,]  8575.490  3780.800     0.000\n\n\n\n\n\nA list sorted according to the the distance matrix by planning sub-zone code is created to hold the sub-zone codes.\n\nsz_names = mpsz$SUBZONE_C\n\nNext, the sub-zone codes are attached to row and column to facilitate distance matrix matching later on.\n\ncolnames(dist) = paste0(sz_names)\nrownames(dist) = paste0(sz_names)\n\n\n\n\nNext, the distance matrix is pivoted into a long table by using the row and column subzone codes.\nNote that the within zone (i.e., when Var1 and Var2 are the same) distance is 0.\n\nStudent Note: Do not use code to sort the data, otherwise the sequence will be messed up.\n\n\ndistPair = melt(dist) %&gt;%\n  rename(dist = value)\nhead(distPair, 10)\n\n     Var1   Var2      dist\n1  MESZ01 MESZ01     0.000\n2  RVSZ05 MESZ01  3926.003\n3  SRSZ01 MESZ01  3939.108\n4  WISZ01 MESZ01 20252.964\n5  MUSZ02 MESZ01  2989.984\n6  MPSZ05 MESZ01  1431.330\n7  WISZ03 MESZ01 19211.836\n8  WISZ02 MESZ01 14960.942\n9  SISZ02 MESZ01  7515.256\n10 SISZ01 MESZ01  6391.342\n\n\n\n\n\nA constant value is then used to replace the intra-zonal distance of 0.\nThe minimum value of the inter-zonal distance is derived using the summary() function. The value is 173.8.

    "text": "Spatial Interaction Models (SIMs) are mathematical models for estimating flows between spatial entities. They were developed by Alan Wilson in the late 1960s and early 1970, with considerable uptake and refinement for transport modelling since then (Boyce and Williams, 2015).\nThere are four main types of traditional SIMs (Wilson 1971):\n\nUnconstrained\nProduction-constrained\nAttraction-constrained\nDoubly-constrained\n\nOrdinary least square (OLS), log-normal, Poisson and negative binomial (NB) regression methods have been used extensively to calibrate OD flow models by processing flow data as different types of dependent variables.\nIn this in-class exercise, the appropriate R packages are used to calibrate SIM by using there four regression methods.\nNote: Calibration is the process of adjusting parameters in the model to try and get the estimates to agree with the observed data as much as possible. Adjusting the parameters is the sort of iterative process that computers are particularly good at and the goodness-of-fit statistics can be used to indicate when the optimum solution is found. Historically, this process required a researcher with the requisite programming skills to write a computer algorithm to iteratively adjust each parameter, check the goodness-of-fit, and then start all over again until the goodness-of-fit statistic was maximised or minimised (Adam Dennett, 2018)."

By definition, an location’s distance from itself, which is shown in the main diagonal of the table, is 0.\nIn this section,a distance matrix is computed by using the mpsz, which is first imported as a sf tibble dataframe object class.\n\nmpsz = read_rds(\"data/rds/mpsz.rds\")\nmpsz\n\nSimple feature collection with 332 features and 6 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2667.538 ymin: 15748.72 xmax: 56396.44 ymax: 50256.33\nProjected CRS: SVY21 / Singapore TM\nFirst 10 features:\n                 SUBZONE_N SUBZONE_C       PLN_AREA_N PLN_AREA_C       REGION_N\n1              MARINA EAST    MESZ01      MARINA EAST         ME CENTRAL REGION\n2         INSTITUTION HILL    RVSZ05     RIVER VALLEY         RV CENTRAL REGION\n3           ROBERTSON QUAY    SRSZ01  SINGAPORE RIVER         SR CENTRAL REGION\n4  JURONG ISLAND AND BUKOM    WISZ01  WESTERN ISLANDS         WI    WEST REGION\n5             FORT CANNING    MUSZ02           MUSEUM         MU CENTRAL REGION\n6         MARINA EAST (MP)    MPSZ05    MARINE PARADE         MP CENTRAL REGION\n7                   SUDONG    WISZ03  WESTERN ISLANDS         WI    WEST REGION\n8                  SEMAKAU    WISZ02  WESTERN ISLANDS         WI    WEST REGION\n9           SOUTHERN GROUP    SISZ02 SOUTHERN ISLANDS         SI CENTRAL REGION\n10                 SENTOSA    SISZ01 SOUTHERN ISLANDS         SI CENTRAL REGION\n   REGION_C                       geometry\n1        CR MULTIPOLYGON (((33222.98 29...\n2        CR MULTIPOLYGON (((28481.45 30...\n3        CR MULTIPOLYGON (((28087.34 30...\n4        WR MULTIPOLYGON (((14557.7 304...\n5        CR MULTIPOLYGON (((29542.53 31...\n6        CR MULTIPOLYGON (((35279.55 30...\n7        WR MULTIPOLYGON (((15772.59 21...\n8        WR MULTIPOLYGON (((19843.41 21...\n9        CR MULTIPOLYGON (((30870.53 22...\n10       CR MULTIPOLYGON (((26879.04 26...\n\n\n\n\nThere are at least two ways to compute the required distance matrix. One is based on sf and the other is based on sp. Past experience shown that computing distance matrix by using sf function took a relatively longer time than the sp method, especially when the data set is large. In view of this, the sp method is used in the code chunks below.\nThe as() function with “Class” argument set as “Spatial” is used to convert mpsz from sf tibble data frame to SpatialPolygonsDataFrame of sp object\n\nStudent Note: For SpatialPolygonsDataFrame, in order to select a variable within a data.frame within the object, we will need to use something like mpsz@data$var_name.\n\n\nmpsz_sp = as(mpsz, \"Spatial\")\nmpsz_sp\n\nclass       : SpatialPolygonsDataFrame \nfeatures    : 332 \nextent      : 2667.538, 56396.44, 15748.72, 50256.33  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncrs         : +proj=tmerc +lat_0=1.36666666666667 +lon_0=103.833333333333 +k=1 +x_0=28001.642 +y_0=38744.572 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs \nvariables   : 6\nnames       : SUBZONE_N, SUBZONE_C, PLN_AREA_N, PLN_AREA_C,       REGION_N, REGION_C \nmin values  : ADMIRALTY,    AMSZ01, ANG MO KIO,         AM, CENTRAL REGION,       CR \nmax values  :    YUNNAN,    YSSZ09,     YISHUN,         YS,    WEST REGION,       WR \n\n\n\n\n\nThe spDists() function in the sp package is used to compute the Euclidean distance between the centroids of the planning subzones.\n\nStudent Note: Calculating the distance between centroids is computationally less intensive compared to more detailed spatial analyses. However, using centroid-to-centroid distance is a simplification and may not always capture the full complexity of spatial relationships.\n\nNotice that the output dist is a matrix object class of R. Also, notice that the column headers and row headers are not labeled with the planning subzone codes.\n\nStudent Note:\n\nIf longlat = TRUE, longitude and latitude are used to calculate the distance.\ndist is a matrix 332 by 332 (based on 332 observations from mpsz).\n\n\n\ndist = spDists(mpsz_sp, \n                longlat = FALSE)\nhead(dist, n=c(10, 10))\n\n           [,1]       [,2]      [,3]      [,4]       [,5]      [,6]      [,7]\n [1,]     0.000  3926.0025  3939.108 20252.964  2989.9839  1431.330 19211.836\n [2,]  3926.003     0.0000   305.737 16513.865   951.8314  5254.066 16242.523\n [3,]  3939.108   305.7370     0.000 16412.062  1045.9088  5299.849 16026.146\n [4,] 20252.964 16513.8648 16412.062     0.000 17450.3044 21665.795  7229.017\n [5,]  2989.984   951.8314  1045.909 17450.304     0.0000  4303.232 17020.916\n [6,]  1431.330  5254.0664  5299.849 21665.795  4303.2323     0.000 20617.082\n [7,] 19211.836 16242.5230 16026.146  7229.017 17020.9161 20617.082     0.000\n [8,] 14960.942 12749.4101 12477.871 11284.279 13336.0421 16281.453  5606.082\n [9,]  7515.256  7934.8082  7649.776 18427.503  7801.6163  8403.896 14810.930\n[10,]  6391.342  4975.0021  4669.295 15469.566  5226.8731  7707.091 13111.391\n           [,8]      [,9]     [,10]\n [1,] 14960.942  7515.256  6391.342\n [2,] 12749.410  7934.808  4975.002\n [3,] 12477.871  7649.776  4669.295\n [4,] 11284.279 18427.503 15469.566\n [5,] 13336.042  7801.616  5226.873\n [6,] 16281.453  8403.896  7707.091\n [7,]  5606.082 14810.930 13111.391\n [8,]     0.000  9472.024  8575.490\n [9,]  9472.024     0.000  3780.800\n[10,]  8575.490  3780.800     0.000\n\n\n\n\n\nA list sorted according to the the distance matrix by planning sub-zone code is created to hold the sub-zone codes.\n\nsz_names = mpsz$SUBZONE_C\n\nNext, the sub-zone codes are attached to row and column to facilitate distance matrix matching later on.\n\ncolnames(dist) = paste0(sz_names)\nrownames(dist) = paste0(sz_names)\n\n\n\n\nNext, the distance matrix is pivoted into a long table by using the row and column subzone codes.\nNote that the within zone (i.e., when Var1 and Var2 are the same) distance is 0.\n\nStudent Note: Do not use code to sort the data, otherwise the sequence will be messed up.\n\n\ndistPair = melt(dist) %&gt;%\n  rename(dist = value)\nhead(distPair, 10)\n\n     Var1   Var2      dist\n1  MESZ01 MESZ01     0.000\n2  RVSZ05 MESZ01  3926.003\n3  SRSZ01 MESZ01  3939.108\n4  WISZ01 MESZ01 20252.964\n5  MUSZ02 MESZ01  2989.984\n6  MPSZ05 MESZ01  1431.330\n7  WISZ03 MESZ01 19211.836\n8  WISZ02 MESZ01 14960.942\n9  SISZ02 MESZ01  7515.256\n10 SISZ01 MESZ01  6391.342\n\n\n\n\n\nA constant value is then used to replace the intra-zonal distance of 0.\nThe minimum value of the inter-zonal distance is derived using the summary() function. The value is 173.8.

This revealed that the variables “ORIGIN_AGE7_12”, “ORIGIN_AGE13_24”, “ORIGIN_AGE25_64”, “DESTIN_AGE7_12”, “DESTIN_AGE13_24”, “DESTIN_AGE25_64” have zero values.\n\nsummary(SIM_data)\n\n  ORIGIN_SZ          DESTIN_SZ             TRIPS           FlowNoIntra      \n Length:14274       Length:14274       Min.   :     1.0   Min.   :     1.0  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:    11.0   1st Qu.:    11.0  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :    56.0   Median :    56.0  \n                                       Mean   :   664.3   Mean   :   664.3  \n                                       3rd Qu.:   296.0   3rd Qu.:   296.0  \n                                       Max.   :104167.0   Max.   :104167.0  \n     offset       dist         ORIGIN_AGE7_12 ORIGIN_AGE13_24 ORIGIN_AGE25_64\n Min.   :1   Min.   :  173.8   Min.   :   0   Min.   :    0   Min.   :    0  \n 1st Qu.:1   1st Qu.: 3465.4   1st Qu.: 240   1st Qu.:  460   1st Qu.: 2210  \n Median :1   Median : 6121.0   Median : 710   Median : 1400   Median : 7030  \n Mean   :1   Mean   : 6951.8   Mean   :1037   Mean   : 2278   Mean   :10536  \n 3rd Qu.:1   3rd Qu.: 9725.1   3rd Qu.:1500   3rd Qu.: 3282   3rd Qu.:15830  \n Max.   :1   Max.   :26135.8   Max.   :6340   Max.   :16380   Max.   :74610  \n DESTIN_AGE7_12 DESTIN_AGE13_24 DESTIN_AGE25_64\n Min.   :   0   Min.   :    0   Min.   :    0  \n 1st Qu.: 250   1st Qu.:  460   1st Qu.: 2210  \n Median : 720   Median : 1430   Median : 7120  \n Mean   :1040   Mean   : 2305   Mean   :10648  \n 3rd Qu.:1500   3rd Qu.: 3290   3rd Qu.:15830  \n Max.   :6340   Max.   :16380   Max.   :74610  \n\n\nIn view of this, these zero values are replaced with the value of 0.99.\n\nSIM_data$DESTIN_AGE7_12 = ifelse(\n  SIM_data$DESTIN_AGE7_12 == 0,\n  0.99, SIM_data$DESTIN_AGE7_12)\nSIM_data$DESTIN_AGE13_24 = ifelse(\n  SIM_data$DESTIN_AGE13_24 == 0,\n  0.99, SIM_data$DESTIN_AGE13_24)\nSIM_data$DESTIN_AGE25_64 = ifelse(\n  SIM_data$DESTIN_AGE25_64 == 0,\n  0.99, SIM_data$DESTIN_AGE25_64)\nSIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE7_12 = ifelse(\n  SIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE7_12 == 0,\n  0.99, SIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE7_12)\nSIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE13_24 = ifelse(\n  SIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE13_24 == 0,\n  0.99, SIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE13_24)\nSIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE25_64 = ifelse(\n  SIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE25_64 == 0,\n  0.99, SIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE25_64)\n\nsummary(SIM_data)\n\n  ORIGIN_SZ          DESTIN_SZ             TRIPS           FlowNoIntra      \n Length:14274       Length:14274       Min.   :     1.0   Min.   :     1.0  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:    11.0   1st Qu.:    11.0  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :    56.0   Median :    56.0  \n                                       Mean   :   664.3   Mean   :   664.3  \n                                       3rd Qu.:   296.0   3rd Qu.:   296.0  \n                                       Max.   :104167.0   Max.   :104167.0  \n     offset       dist         ORIGIN_AGE7_12    ORIGIN_AGE13_24   \n Min.   :1   Min.   :  173.8   Min.   :   0.99   Min.   :    0.99  \n 1st Qu.:1   1st Qu.: 3465.4   1st Qu.: 240.00   1st Qu.:  460.00  \n Median :1   Median : 6121.0   Median : 710.00   Median : 1400.00  \n Mean   :1   Mean   : 6951.8   Mean   :1036.73   Mean   : 2278.59  \n 3rd Qu.:1   3rd Qu.: 9725.1   3rd Qu.:1500.00   3rd Qu.: 3282.50  \n Max.   :1   Max.   :26135.8   Max.   :6340.00   Max.   :16380.00  \n ORIGIN_AGE25_64    DESTIN_AGE7_12    DESTIN_AGE13_24    DESTIN_AGE25_64   \n Min.   :    0.99   Min.   :   0.99   Min.   :    0.99   Min.   :    0.99  \n 1st Qu.: 2210.00   1st Qu.: 250.00   1st Qu.:  460.00   1st Qu.: 2210.00  \n Median : 7030.00   Median : 720.00   Median : 1430.00   Median : 7120.00  \n Mean   :10535.93   Mean   :1039.98   Mean   : 2305.33   Mean   :10647.95  \n 3rd Qu.:15830.00   3rd Qu.:1500.00   3rd Qu.: 3290.00   3rd Qu.:15830.00  \n Max.   :74610.00   Max.   :6340.00   Max.   :16380.00   Max.   :74610.00  \n\n\n\n\n\nAn unconstrained SIM is calibrated below by using the glm() function of the stats package.

    "text": "3 Importing Data\nFor the purpose of the in-class exercise, the Hunan data sets are used:\n\nHunan’s County Boundary Layer. This is a geospatial data set in ESRI shapefile format.\nHunan’s Local Development Indicators 2012. This csv file contains data on selected Hunan’s local development indicators in 2012.\n\nThe data sets are placed under two sub-folders:\n\ngeospatial (County Boundary Layer), and\naspatial (Local Development Indicators 2012).\n\nThese two sub-folders are within the data folder of my In-class_Ex2 folder.\n\n3.1 Importing shapefile\nThe st_read() (under sf package) is used to import the geospatial data set: hunan, a polygon feature layer in ESRI shapefile format.\n\nStudent Note: The geospatial objects are polygon features.

    "text": "4 Deriving Contiguity Spatial Weights\nBy and large, there are two type of spatial weights, they are contiguity weights and distance-based weights. In this section, the contiguity spatial weights are derived by using sfdep package.\nThe two steps for deriving contiguity spatial weights are:\n\nIdentify contiguity neighbour list using st_contiguity() (under sfdep package); and\nDerive contiguity spatial weights using st_weights() (under sfdep package).\n\n\n4.1 Identifying Contiguity Neighbours Using Queen’s Method\nThe st_contiguity() (under sfdep package) is used to derive a contiguity neighbour list using Queen’s method.\n\nStudent Note: The “queen” argument in the function is set to either TRUE (default) or FALSE. The TRUE option will return a list of first order neighbours using the Queen’s contiguity criteria; the FALSE option will return a list of first order neighbours using the Rook’s method. According to Queen’s criteria, two regions are considered neighbours if they share any part of their boundary (even if it is a single point). This results in a more inclusive definition of neighbour relationships.\n\n\nStudent Note: The summary report below shows that there are 88 area units in nb_queen. The most connected area unit (85) has 11 neighbours. The least connected area units (30 and 65) have only one neighbour each.\n\n\nStudent Note: The .before = 1 argument indicates that the new column, “nb”, should appear at the front.\n\n\nnb_queen = hunan_GDPPC %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb = st_contiguity(geometry),\n         .before = 1)\n\nsummary(nb_queen$nb)\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 11 \n 2  2 12 16 24 14 11  4  2  1 \n2 least connected regions:\n30 65 with 1 link\n1 most connected region:\n85 with 11 links\n\nnb_queen\n\nSimple feature collection with 88 features and 7 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 108.7831 ymin: 24.6342 xmax: 114.2544 ymax: 30.12812\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\nFirst 10 features:\n                               nb   NAME_2  ID_3    NAME_3   ENGTYPE_3\n1                 2, 3, 4, 57, 85  Changde 21098   Anxiang      County\n2               1, 57, 58, 78, 85  Changde 21100   Hanshou      County\n3                     1, 4, 5, 85  Changde 21101    Jinshi County City\n4                      1, 3, 5, 6  Changde 21102        Li      County\n5                     3, 4, 6, 85  Changde 21103     Linli      County\n6                4, 5, 69, 75, 85  Changde 21104    Shimen      County\n7                  67, 71, 74, 84 Changsha 21109   Liuyang County City\n8       9, 46, 47, 56, 78, 80, 86 Changsha 21110 Ningxiang      County\n9           8, 66, 68, 78, 84, 86 Changsha 21111 Wangcheng      County\n10 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 70, 72, 73 Chenzhou 21112     Anren      County\n      County GDPPC                       geometry\n1    Anxiang 23667 POLYGON ((112.0625 29.75523...\n2    Hanshou 20981 POLYGON ((112.2288 29.11684...\n3     Jinshi 34592 POLYGON ((111.8927 29.6013,...\n4         Li 24473 POLYGON ((111.3731 29.94649...\n5      Linli 25554 POLYGON ((111.6324 29.76288...\n6     Shimen 27137 POLYGON ((110.8825 30.11675...\n7    Liuyang 63118 POLYGON ((113.9905 28.5682,...\n8  Ningxiang 62202 POLYGON ((112.7181 28.38299...\n9  Wangcheng 70666 POLYGON ((112.7914 28.52688...\n10     Anren 12761 POLYGON ((113.1757 26.82734...\n\n\nOne of the advantage of sfdep over spdep is that the former’s output is an sf tibble data frame.\n\nkable(head(nb_queen,\n           n = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnb\nNAME_2\nID_3\nNAME_3\nENGTYPE_3\nCounty\nGDPPC\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n2, 3, 4, 57, 85\nChangde\n21098\nAnxiang\nCounty\nAnxiang\n23667\nPOLYGON ((112.0625 29.75523…\n\n\n1, 57, 58, 78, 85\nChangde\n21100\nHanshou\nCounty\nHanshou\n20981\nPOLYGON ((112.2288 29.11684…\n\n\n1, 4, 5, 85\nChangde\n21101\nJinshi\nCounty City\nJinshi\n34592\nPOLYGON ((111.8927 29.6013,…\n\n\n1, 3, 5, 6\nChangde\n21102\nLi\nCounty\nLi\n24473\nPOLYGON ((111.3731 29.94649…\n\n\n3, 4, 6, 85\nChangde\n21103\nLinli\nCounty\nLinli\n25554\nPOLYGON ((111.6324 29.76288…\n\n\n4, 5, 69, 75, 85\nChangde\n21104\nShimen\nCounty\nShimen\n27137\nPOLYGON ((110.8825 30.11675…\n\n\n67, 71, 74, 84\nChangsha\n21109\nLiuyang\nCounty City\nLiuyang\n63118\nPOLYGON ((113.9905 28.5682,…\n\n\n9, 46, 47, 56, 78, 80, 86\nChangsha\n21110\nNingxiang\nCounty\nNingxiang\n62202\nPOLYGON ((112.7181 28.38299…\n\n\n8, 66, 68, 78, 84, 86\nChangsha\n21111\nWangcheng\nCounty\nWangcheng\n70666\nPOLYGON ((112.7914 28.52688…\n\n\n16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 70, 72, 73\nChenzhou\n21112\nAnren\nCounty\nAnren\n12761\nPOLYGON ((113.1757 26.82734…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Identifying Contiguity Neighbours Using Rooks’ Method\nThe st_contiguity() (under sfdep package) is used to derive a contiguity neighbour list using Rooks’ method.\n\nStudent Note: The “queen” argument in the function is set to either TRUE (default) or FALSE.

The wt values of each neighbour of a polygon are the same as a result of fixed distance weights.\n\n\n\n5.2 Deriving Adaptive Distance Weights\nOne of the characteristics of fixed distance weight matrix is that more densely settled areas (usually the urban areas) tend to have more neighbours and the less densely settled areas (usually the rural counties) tend to have less neighbours.

The polygon features usually represent administration boundaries or a custom grid structure.\n\n8.1 Computing Local Gi* Statistics\nThe inverse distance weights (IDW) are already computed in section 5.3 above.\n\nwm_idw\n\nSimple feature collection with 88 features and 8 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 108.7831 ymin: 24.6342 xmax: 114.2544 ymax: 30.12812\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\nFirst 10 features:\n                               nb\n1                 2, 3, 4, 57, 85\n2               1, 57, 58, 78, 85\n3                     1, 4, 5, 85\n4                      1, 3, 5, 6\n5                     3, 4, 6, 85\n6                4, 5, 69, 75, 85\n7                  67, 71, 74, 84\n8       9, 46, 47, 56, 78, 80, 86\n9           8, 66, 68, 78, 84, 86\n10 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 70, 72, 73\n                                                                                              wts\n1                                      0.01526149, 0.03515537, 0.02176677, 0.02836978, 0.01029857\n2                                      0.01526149, 0.01601100, 0.01911052, 0.02327058, 0.01591694\n3                                                  0.03515537, 0.04581089, 0.04116397, 0.01208437\n4                                                  0.02176677, 0.04581089, 0.04637578, 0.01585302\n5                                                  0.04116397, 0.04637578, 0.01896212, 0.01351099\n6                                      0.01585302, 0.01896212, 0.02710909, 0.01140718, 0.01080890\n7                                                  0.01621067, 0.01536702, 0.01133628, 0.01836488\n8              0.01930410, 0.02675555, 0.02151751, 0.01076895, 0.02608065, 0.01519804, 0.01337412\n9                          0.01930410, 0.01651371, 0.01798519, 0.01473155, 0.03015561, 0.01612293\n10 0.02737233, 0.01390810, 0.01458881, 0.02156771, 0.02419268, 0.02350470, 0.01784174, 0.01621545\n     NAME_2  ID_3    NAME_3   ENGTYPE_3    County GDPPC\n1   Changde 21098   Anxiang      County   Anxiang 23667\n2   Changde 21100   Hanshou      County   Hanshou 20981\n3   Changde 21101    Jinshi County City    Jinshi 34592\n4   Changde 21102        Li      County        Li 24473\n5   Changde 21103     Linli      County     Linli 25554\n6   Changde 21104    Shimen      County    Shimen 27137\n7  Changsha 21109   Liuyang County City   Liuyang 63118\n8  Changsha 21110 Ningxiang      County Ningxiang 62202\n9  Changsha 21111 Wangcheng      County Wangcheng 70666\n10 Chenzhou 21112     Anren      County     Anren 12761\n                         geometry\n1  POLYGON ((112.0625 29.75523...\n2  POLYGON ((112.2288 29.11684...\n3  POLYGON ((111.8927 29.6013,...\n4  POLYGON ((111.3731 29.94649...\n5  POLYGON ((111.6324 29.76288...\n6  POLYGON ((110.8825 30.11675...\n7  POLYGON ((113.9905 28.5682,...\n8  POLYGON ((112.7181 28.38299...\n9  POLYGON ((112.7914 28.52688...\n10 POLYGON ((113.1757 26.82734...\n\n\nThe local_gstar_perm() (under sfdep package) is used to compute local Gi* statistics.\n\nHCSA = wm_idw %&gt;% \n  mutate(local_Gi = local_gstar_perm(\n    GDPPC, nb, wt, nsim = 99),\n         .before = 1) %&gt;%\n  unnest(local_Gi)\n\nHCSA\n\nSimple feature collection with 88 features and 16 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 108.7831 ymin: 24.6342 xmax: 114.2544 ymax: 30.12812\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n# A tibble: 88 × 17\n   gi_star   e_gi    var_gi p_value   p_sim p_folded_sim skewness kurtosis nb   \n     &lt;dbl&gt;

    "text": "9 Emerging Hot Spot Analysis\nEmerging Hot Spot Analysis (EHSA) is a spatio-temporal analysis method for revealing and describing how hot spot and cold spot areas evolve over time.\nThe analysis consist of four main steps:\n\nBuild a space-time cube;\nCalculate Getis-Ord local Gi* statistic for each bin by using an False Discovery rate (FDR) correction;\n\nStudent Note: FDR is used to adjust p-values for multiple comparisons to address the issue of inflated Type I errors when conducting many test simultaneously, such as when assessing the significance of local spatial clusters.\n\nEvaluate the hot and cold spot trends by using Mann-Kendall trend test;\nCategorise each study area location by referring to the resultant trend z-score and p-value for each location within data, and with the hot spot z-score and p-value for each bin.\n\n\n9.1 Importing Attribute Table\nThe read_csv() (under readr package) is used to import Hunan_GDPPC.csv.\n\nGDPPC = read_csv(\"data/aspatial/Hunan_GDPPC.csv\")\n\n\nStudent Note: ‘Year’ variable is numerical data type (not datetime).\n\n\n\n9.2 Creating a Time Series Cube\nThe spacetime() (under sfdep package) is used to create a spacetime cube.\n\nGDPPC_st = spacetime(GDPPC, hunan,\n                     .loc_col = \"County\",\n                     .time_col = \"Year\")\n\nThe is_spacetime_cube() (under sfdep package) is used to verify if GDPPC_st is indeed a spacetime cube object. The TRUE return below confirms that GDPPC_st object is indeed a spacetime cube.\n\nis_spacetime_cube(GDPPC_st)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n9.3 Computing Gi* Statistics\nThe Gi* statistics is then computed by identifying neighbours, deriving an inverse distance weights, and then calculating the local Gi* for each location.\n\nactivate() (under dplyr package) is used to activate the geometry context\nmutate() (under dplyr package) is used to create two new columns “nb” and “wt”.\nset_nbs() and set_wts() (both under sfdep package) are used to activate the data context again and copy over the nb and wt columns to each time-slice.\n\nThe row order is very important so do not rearrange the observations after using set_nbs() or set_wts().\n\n\n\nGDPPC_nb = GDPPC_st %&gt;%\n  activate(\"geometry\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(nb = include_self(st_contiguity(geometry)),\n         wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, geometry,\n                                  scale = 1,\n                                  alpha = 1),\n         .before = 1) %&gt;%\n  set_nbs(\"nb\") %&gt;%\n  set_wts(\"wt\")\n\nhead(GDPPC_nb)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n   Year County  GDPPC nb        wt       \n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;list&gt;    &lt;list&gt;   \n1  2005 Anxiang  8184 &lt;int [6]&gt; &lt;dbl [6]&gt;\n2  2005 Hanshou  6560 &lt;int [6]&gt; &lt;dbl [6]&gt;\n3  2005 Jinshi   9956 &lt;int [5]&gt; &lt;dbl [5]&gt;\n4  2005 Li       8394 &lt;int [5]&gt; &lt;dbl [5]&gt;\n5  2005 Linli    8850 &lt;int [5]&gt; &lt;dbl [5]&gt;\n6  2005 Shimen   9244 &lt;int [6]&gt; &lt;dbl [6]&gt;\n\n\nThe new columns are then used to calculate the local Gi* for each location. This is done by grouping by “Year” and using local_gstar_perm() (under sfdep package). Then, unnest() (under tidyr package) is used to unnest the “gi_star” column of the newly created gi_stars data frame.\n\ngi_stars = GDPPC_nb %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  mutate(gi_star = local_gstar_perm(\n    GDPPC, nb, wt)) %&gt;%\n  unnest(gi_star)\n\nhead(gi_stars)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 13\n# Groups:   Year [1]\n   Year County  GDPPC nb        wt        gi_star   e_gi   var_gi  p_value p_sim\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;list&gt;    &lt;list&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  2005 Anxiang  8184 &lt;int [6]&gt; &lt;dbl [6]&gt;   0.398 0.0115  2.69e-6  0.382   0.702\n2  2005 Hanshou  6560 &lt;int [6]&gt; &lt;dbl [6]&gt;  -0.237 0.0109  2.64e-6  0.00199 0.998\n3  2005 Jinshi   9956 &lt;int [5]&gt; &lt;dbl [5]&gt;   1.05  0.0126  3.33e-6  0.507   0.612\n4  2005 Li       8394 &lt;int [5]&gt; &lt;dbl [5]&gt;   0.966 0.0117  3.24e-6  0.920   0.357\n5  2005 Linli    8850 &lt;int [5]&gt; &lt;dbl [5]&gt;   1.05  0.0120  3.23e-6  0.885   0.376\n6  2005 Shimen   9244 &lt;int [6]&gt; &lt;dbl [6]&gt;   0.210 0.0121  2.99e-6 -0.215   0.830\n# ℹ 3 more variables: p_folded_sim &lt;dbl&gt;, skewness &lt;dbl&gt;, kurtosis &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n9.4 Mann-Kendall Test\nEach location is then evaluated for a trend using the Mann-Kendall test. For illustration, Changsha (provincial capital of Hunan) is tested below.\n\nStudent Note: The |&gt; symbol is called the “pipe-forward” operator, and it is used in the context of the magrittr package in R. It was introduced in magrittr to provide an alternative to the %&gt;% pipe operator. The |&gt; operator is part of the native syntax of R since version 4.1.0.

The default = 1 means comparing time series sequentially.\nThe “nsim” argument states the number of simulations to be performed.\n\n\nehsa = emerging_hotspot_analysis(\n  x = GDPPC_st, \n  .var = \"GDPPC\", \n  k = 1, \n  nsim = 99\n)\n\nhead(ehsa)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  location    tau    p_value classification     \n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;              \n1 Anxiang   0.221 0.232      sporadic coldspot  \n2 Hanshou   0.147 0.434      sporadic hotspot   \n3 Jinshi    0.441 0.0151     oscilating hotspot \n4 Li       -0.824 0.00000482 sporadic coldspot  \n5 Linli     0.118 0.537      oscilating hotspot \n6 Shimen   -0.471 0.00946    oscilating coldspot\n\n\n\n\n9.6 Visualising Distribution of Emerging Hot Spot Analysis Classes\nThe functions in ggplot2 package are used to reveal the distribution of EHSA classes using bar chart.\nThe bar chat below shows that sporadic cold spots class has the high numbers of counties.\n\nggplot(data = ehsa,\n       aes(x = classification)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.7 Visualising Emerging Hot Spot Analysis\nThe hunan and ehsa data frames are joined.\n\nhunan_ehsa = hunan %&gt;%\n  left_join(ehsa,\n            by = join_by(County == location))\n\nThe geographic distribution of EHSA classes are then plotted using functions in tmap package.\n\nehsa_sig = hunan_ehsa  %&gt;%\n  filter(p_value &lt; 0.05)\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\ntm_shape(hunan_ehsa) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\ntm_shape(ehsa_sig) +\n  tm_fill(\"classification\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.4)\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Note: Interpretation\n\nThe grey areas mean that there are no statistically significant values. This is not the same as no pattern (which could be statistically significant).\nThere is a mix of different types of hot or cold spot patterns in Hunan.\nFocusing on the class with the most number of counties, the presence of sporadic cold spots indicates that there are many counties that are on-again, off-again cold spots over time (i.e., spatial concentration of low GDPPC values).\nThere are also a number of sporadic hot spots, which indicates that there are some counties that are on-again, off-again hot spots over time (i.e., spatial concentration of high GDPPC values).\nOverall, the high number of sporadic classes (both hot and cold) indicates that the trends of spatial concentration of GDPPC values in many counties in Hunan are not stable or linear (increasing or decreasing over time) but are more unpredictable. This also means that spatial patterns in GDPPC are not static across different time periods.\n\n\n~~~ End of In-class Exercise 2 ~~~"

    "text": "Spatial interaction represent the flow of people, material, or information between locations in geographical space.\nEach spatial interaction, as an analogy for a set of movements, is composed of a discrete origin-destination pair. Each pair can be represented as a cell in a matrix where rows are related to the locations (centroids) of origin, while columns are related to locations (centroids) of destination. Such a matrix is commonly known as an origin-destination matrix, or a spatial interaction matrix.\nIn this page, I show how I had completed the Hands-on Exercise 3 on building an Origin-Destination (OD) matrix by using the Passenger Volume by Origin Destination Bus Stops data set downloaded from LTA DataMall.\nThe objectives are:\n\nImport and extract OD data for a selected time interval;\nImport and save geospatial data (i.e. Bus Stop Location and Master Plan Subzone Boundary) into sf tibble data frame objects;\nPopulate planning subzone code into bus stops sf tibble data frame;\nConstruct desire lines geospatial data from the OD data; and\nVisualise passenger volume by origin and destination bus stops by using the desire lines data.\n\n\n\n\nThe R packages used in this hands-on exercise are:\n\nsf for importing, managing, and processing geospatial data;\ntidyverse (i.e. readr, tidyr, dplyr) for performing data science tasks such as importing, tidying, and wrangling data;\ntmap for thematic mapping;\nDT a wrapper of the JavaScript Library ‘DataTables’ for creating interactive and dynamic data tables;\nstplanr for working with spatial data related to transportation and urban planning;\nperformance for the assessment of regression models performance; and\nggpubr for creating customised and annotated ggplot2 plots for better visualisation.\n\n\npacman::p_load(tmap, sf, DT, stplanr,\n               performance,\n               ggpubr, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, we will import the Passenger Volume by Origin Destination Bus Stops data set downloaded from LTA DataMall by using read_csv() of readr package.\n\nodbus = read_csv(\"data/aspatial/origin_destination_bus_202310.csv\")\n\nglimpse(odbus)\n\nRows: 5,694,297\nColumns: 7\n$ YEAR_MONTH          &lt;chr&gt; \"2023-10\", \"2023-10\", \"2023-10\", \"2023-10\", \"2023-…\n$ DAY_TYPE            &lt;chr&gt; \"WEEKENDS/HOLIDAY\", \"WEEKDAY\", \"WEEKENDS/HOLIDAY\",…\n$ TIME_PER_HOUR       &lt;dbl&gt; 16, 16, 14, 14, 17, 17, 17, 7, 14, 14, 10, 20, 20,…\n$ PT_TYPE             &lt;chr&gt; \"BUS\", \"BUS\", \"BUS\", \"BUS\", \"BUS\", \"BUS\", \"BUS\", \"…\n$ ORIGIN_PT_CODE      &lt;chr&gt; \"04168\", \"04168\", \"80119\", \"80119\", \"44069\", \"2028…\n$ DESTINATION_PT_CODE &lt;chr&gt; \"10051\", \"10051\", \"90079\", \"90079\", \"17229\", \"2014…\n$ TOTAL_TRIPS         &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 5, 3, 5, 4, 1, 24, 2, 1, 7, 3, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1…\n\n\nThe values in “ORIGIN_PT_CODE” and “DESTINATON_PT_CODE” are in character data type.

Since one contains points, and the other contains polygons, the output will contain points (as the points are the common overlapping spatial objects).\nThe st_drop_geometry() function is used to remove the geometry column from the combined sf data frame.

This csv file contains data on selected Hunan’s local development indicators in 2012.\n\nThe data sets are placed under two sub-folders:\n\ngeospatial (County Boundary Layer), and\naspatial (Local Development Indicators 2012).\n\nThese two sub-folders are within the data folder of my Hands-on_Ex2 folder.\n\n\nThe st_read() (under sf package) is used to import the geospatial data set: hunan, a polygon feature layer in ESRI shapefile format.\n\nStudent Note: The geospatial objects are polygon features. There are a total of 88 features and 8 fields in hunan simple feature data frame. hunan is in wgs84 coordinate system.\n\n\nhunan = st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\", \n                 layer = \"Hunan\")\n\nReading layer `Hunan' from data source \n  `C:\\jmphosis\\ISSS624\\Hands-on_Ex\\Hands-on_Ex2\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 88 features and 7 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 108.7831 ymin: 24.6342 xmax: 114.2544 ymax: 30.12812\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\n\n\n\nThe read_csv() (under readr package) is used to import the aspatial data set: hunan_2012, a csv file.\n\nStudent Note: The hunan_2012 tibble data frame contains 88 rows and 29 columns.

The typical method used for polygons is to find the polygon centroids. These can be calculated using the sf package.\nThe mapping function, map_dbl() (under the purrr package) is utilised to apply a function, st_centroid() (under sf package), on each element of the geometry column, us.bound, returning a vector of a same length.\nThe longitude is then extracted by looking for the first value of each centroid, while the latitude is extracted by looking for the second value of each centroid. The cbind() is then used to put the two values together.\n\nlongitude = map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])\n\nlatitude = map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])\n\ncoords = cbind(longitude, latitude)\n\nhead(coords)\n\n     longitude latitude\n[1,]  112.1531 29.44362\n[2,]  112.0372 28.86489\n[3,]  111.8917 29.47107\n[4,]  111.7031 29.74499\n[5,]  111.6138 29.49258\n[6,]  111.0341 29.79863\n\n\nThe neighbours maps using the Queen’s criteria and Rook’s criteria respectively are then plotted below.\n\nStudent Note: The par() (under graphics package) is used to plot the two maps side by side. The “main” argument is used to add titles for the two maps.\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2))\n\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\", main = \"Queen's Continguity Criteria\")\nplot(wm_q, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col= \"red\")\n\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\", main = \"Rook's Continguity Criteria\")\nplot(wm_r, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dnearneigh() (under spdep package) is used to calculate distance-based weight matrices for the study area.\nThe function identifies neighbours of region points by Euclidean distance with a distance band with lower “d1” and upper “d2” bounds controlled by the bounds argument. If unprojected coordinates are used and either specified in the coordinates object x or with x as a two column matrix and “longlat” set as TRUE, great circle distances in km will be calculated assuming the WGS84 reference ellipsoid.\n\n\nThe upper limit for the distance band is determined by using the following steps and functions under the spdep package:\n\nReturn a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours (knn) of each other by using knearneigh().\n\nStudent Note: In the matrix, each row corresponds to a point, and the columns contain the indices of its knn.\n\nConvert the knn object into a neighbours list of class nb with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids by using knn2nb().\nReturn the length of neighbour relationship edges by using nbdists(). This function returns in the units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, and in km otherwise.\nRemove the list structure of the returned object by using unlist() (under base package).\n\nThe summary report below shows that the largest first nearest neighbour distance is 61.79 km (i.e., max value). Thus, this is used as the upper threshold as it ensures that all units will have at least one neighbour.\n\nk1 = knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))\n\nk1dists = unlist(nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = TRUE))\n\nsummary(k1dists)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Using “comp.id”, the connected component(s) and their size(s) (i.e., number of spatial units belonging to each) are extracted.\n\nStudent Note: Since n_comp$nc = 1, it means that there is only one connected component in wm_d62. Having only one connected component suggests that the entire study area is spatially connected, and there are no distinct subgroups that are not linked to each other.\n\n\nn_comp = n.comp.nb(wm_d62)\nn_comp$nc\n\n[1] 1\n\ntable(n_comp$comp.id)\n\n\n 1 \n88 \n\n\nThe distance weight matrix is then plotted.

Having many neighbours smoothes the neighbour relationship across more neighbours.\nIt is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using knn, either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry as shown below.\n\nStudent Note: Fixing the k argument’s value in knearneigh() means that the number of neighbours for each region is exactly 6.\n\n\nknn6 = knn2nb(knearneigh(coords,

The nb21listw() (under spdep package) is used to convert a neighborhood object, wm_q, to a listw object, rswm_q (style=“W”) or rswm_ids (style=“B”). This allows row-standardised distance weight matrices to be created, whereby each row sums to 1.\nThe “style” argument influences the specific characteristics of the weights matrix.\nThe following example shows “style=”W””, each neighboring polygon is assigned equal weight. This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. While this is the most intuitive way to summarise the neighbors’ values, its downside is that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data.\n\nStudent Note:\n\n“listw” stands for list of weights.\nThe “style” argument set to “W” specifies a binary spatial weight matrix, where the presence of a spatial relationship is indicated by 1, and absence by 0. All neighbouring units are considered equal in terms of their impact on the target unit, reflecting a uniform spatial relationship.\nThe “zero.policy” argument returns lists of non-neighbours when set to TRUE.\n\n\n\nrswm_q = nb2listw(wm_q, style=\"W\", zero.policy = TRUE)\nrswm_q\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: W \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn S0       S1       S2\nW 88 7744 88 37.86334 365.9147\n\n\nThe weights of the first polygon’s eight neighbours are extracted below. It shows that each neighbour is assigned an equal weight of 0.2 of the total weight. This means that when computing the average neighbouring income values, each neighbour’s income will be multiplied by 0.2 before being tallied.\n\nStudent Note: In this example, each neighbour has an equal weight, indicating a form of uniform spatial relationship.\n\n\nrswm_q$weights[1]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2\n\n\nOn the other hand, for “style=”B””, the spatial lag of a variable for a particular unit is the sum of that variable over all neighbouring units, with each neighbour contributing a binary indicator (1 or 0).\n\nStudent Note:\n\n“glist=ids” means the list of inverse distances is used for the general list of weights argument.\nThe “style” argument set to “B” specifies a binary spatial lag matrix, where the presence of a spatial relationship is indicated by 1, and absence by 0.

This means that when computing the average neighbouring income values, each neighbour’s income will be multiplied by their corresponding weight values before being tallied.\n\nStudent Note: In this example, each neighbour has an equal weight, indicating a form of uniform spatial relationship.\n\n\nrswm_ids$weights[1]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 0.01535405 0.03916350 0.01820896 0.02807922 0.01145113\n\n\n\nStudent Note: The summary below shows the range of weights using “style=”B”” and IDW.

It is calculated using the weighted average of the values of a variable in neighbouring units, where the weights are row standardised.\n\nComparing the outcome below with the neighbouring GDP per capita values found in section 8.5.1 above, it is observed that each element GDPPC.lag is the average GDP per capita value of the neighbouring polygons.

The typical method used for polygons is to find the polygon centroids. These can be calculated using the sf package.\nThe mapping function, map_dbl() (under the purrr package) is utilised to apply a function, st_centroid() (under sf package), on each element of the geometry column, us.bound, returning a vector of a same length.\nThe longitude is then extracted by looking for the first value of each centroid, while the latitude is extracted by looking for the second value of each centroid. The cbind() is then used to put the two values together.\n\nlongitude = map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])\n\nlatitude = map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])\n\ncoords = cbind(longitude, latitude)\n\nhead(coords)\n\n     longitude latitude\n[1,]  112.1531 29.44362\n[2,]  112.0372 28.86489\n[3,]  111.8917 29.47107\n[4,]  111.7031 29.74499\n[5,]  111.6138 29.49258\n[6,]  111.0341 29.79863\n\n\nThe neighbours maps using the Queen’s criteria and Rook’s criteria respectively are then plotted below.\n\nStudent Note: The par() (under graphics package) is used to plot the two maps side by side.

    "text": "The dnearneigh() (under spdep package) is used to calculate distance-based weight matrices for the study area.\nThe function identifies neighbours of region points by Euclidean distance with a distance band with lower “d1” and upper “d2” bounds controlled by the bounds argument. If unprojected coordinates are used and either specified in the coordinates object x or with x as a two column matrix and “longlat” set as TRUE, great circle distances in km will be calculated assuming the WGS84 reference ellipsoid.\n\n\nThe upper limit for the distance band is determined by using the following steps and functions under the spdep package:\n\nReturn a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours (knn) of each other by using knearneigh().\n\nStudent Note: In the matrix, each row corresponds to a point, and the columns contain the indices of its knn.\n\nConvert the knn object into a neighbours list of class nb with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids by using knn2nb().\nReturn the length of neighbour relationship edges by using nbdists(). This function returns in the units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, and in km otherwise.\nRemove the list structure of the returned object by using unlist() (under base package).\n\nThe summary report below shows that the largest first nearest neighbour distance is 61.79 km (i.e., max value).

Using “comp.id”, the connected component(s) and their size(s) (i.e., number of spatial units belonging to each) are extracted.\n\nStudent Note: Since n_comp$nc = 1, it means that there is only one connected component in wm_d62. Having only one connected component suggests that the entire study area is spatially connected, and there are no distinct subgroups that are not linked to each other.\n\n\nn_comp = n.comp.nb(wm_d62)\nn_comp$nc\n\n[1] 1\n\ntable(n_comp$comp.id)\n\n\n 1 \n88 \n\n\nThe distance weight matrix is then plotted. The red lines show the links of the first nearest neighbours, while the black lines show the links of neighbours within cut-off distance of 62 km. Alternatively, they can be plotted side by side.\n\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\")\nplot(wm_d62, coords, add=TRUE)\nplot(k1, coords, add=TRUE, col=\"red\", length=0.08)\n\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\")\nplot(k1, coords, add=TRUE, col=\"red\", length=0.08, main=\"1st Nearest Neighbours\")\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\")\nplot(wm_d62, coords, add=TRUE, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, main=\"Distance Link (Cut-off = 62km)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the characteristics of fixed distance weight matrix is that more densely settled areas (usually the urban areas) tend to have more neighbours and the less densely settled areas (usually the rural counties) tend to have less neighbours. Having many neighbours smoothes the neighbour relationship across more neighbours.\nIt is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using knn, either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry as shown below.\n\nStudent Note: Fixing the k argument’s value in knearneigh() means that the number of neighbours for each region is exactly 6.\n\n\nknn6 = knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=6))\nknn6\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 528 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 6.818182 \nAverage number of links: 6 \nNon-symmetric neighbours list\n\nstr(knn6)\n\nList of 88\n $ : int [1:6] 2 3 4 5 57 64\n $ : int [1:6] 1 3 57 58 78 85\n $ : int [1:6] 1 2 4 5 57 85\n $ : int [1:6] 1 3 5 6 69 85\n $ : int [1:6] 1 3 4 6 69 85\n $ : int [1:6] 3 4 5 69 75 85\n $ : int [1:6] 9 66 67 71 74 84\n $ : int [1:6] 9 46 47 78 80 86\n $ : int [1:6] 8 46 66 68 84 86\n $ : int [1:6] 16 19 22 70 72 73\n $ : int [1:6] 10 14 16 17 70 72\n $ : int [1:6] 13 15 60 61 63 83\n $ : int [1:6] 12 15 60 61 63 83\n $ : int [1:6] 11 15 16 17 72 83\n $ : int [1:6] 12 13 14 17 60 83\n $ : int [1:6] 10 11 17 22 72 83\n $ : int [1:6] 10 11 14 16 72 83\n $ : int [1:6] 20 22 23 63 77 83\n $ : int [1:6] 10 20 21 73 74 82\n $ : int [1:6] 18 19 21 22 23 82\n $ : int [1:6] 19 20 35 74 82 86\n $ : int [1:6] 10 16 18 19 20 83\n $ : int [1:6] 18 20 41 77 79 82\n $ : int [1:6] 25 28 31 52 54 81\n $ : int [1:6] 24 28 31 33 54 81\n $ : int [1:6] 25 27 29 33 42 81\n $ : int [1:6] 26 29 30 37 42 81\n $ : int [1:6] 24 25 33 49 52 54\n $ : int [1:6] 26 27 37 42 43 81\n $ : int [1:6] 26 27 28 33 49 81\n $ : int [1:6] 24 25 36 39 40 54\n $ : int [1:6] 24 31 50 54 55 56\n $ : int [1:6] 25 26 28 30 49 81\n $ : int [1:6] 36 40 41 45 56 80\n $ : int [1:6] 21 41 46 47 80 82\n $ : int [1:6] 31 34 40 45 56 80\n $ : int [1:6] 26 27 29 42 43 44\n $ : int [1:6] 23 43 44 62 77 79\n $ : int [1:6] 25 40 42 43 44 81\n $ : int [1:6] 31 36 39 43 45 79\n $ : int [1:6] 23 35 45 79 80 82\n $ : int [1:6] 26 27 37 39 43 81\n $ : int [1:6] 37 39 40 42 44 79\n $ : int [1:6] 37 38 39 42 43 79\n $ : int [1:6] 34 36 40 41 79 80\n $ : int [1:6] 8 9 35 47 78 86\n $ : int [1:6] 8 21 35 46 80 86\n $ : int [1:6] 49 50 51 52 53 55\n $ : int [1:6] 28 33 48 51 52 54\n $ : int [1:6] 32 48 51 52 54 55\n $ : int [1:6] 28 48 49 50 52 54\n $ : int [1:6] 28 48 49 50 51 54\n $ : int [1:6] 48 50 51 52 55 75\n $ : int [1:6] 24 28 49 50 51 52\n $ : int [1:6] 32 48 50 52 53 75\n $ : int [1:6] 32 34 36 78 80 85\n $ : int [1:6] 1 2 3 58 64 68\n $ : int [1:6] 2 57 64 66 68 78\n $ : int [1:6] 12 13 60 61 87 88\n $ : int [1:6] 12 13 59 61 63 87\n $ : int [1:6] 12 13 60 62 63 87\n $ : int [1:6] 12 38 61 63 77 87\n $ : int [1:6] 12 18 60 61 62 83\n $ : int [1:6] 1 3 57 58 68 76\n $ : int [1:6] 58 64 66 67 68 76\n $ : int [1:6] 9 58 67 68 76 84\n $ : int [1:6] 7 65 66 68 76 84\n $ : int [1:6] 9 57 58 66 78 84\n $ : int [1:6] 4 5 6 32 75 85\n $ : int [1:6] 10 16 19 22 72 73\n $ : int [1:6] 7 19 73 74 84 86\n $ : int [1:6] 10 11 14 16 17 70\n $ : int [1:6] 10 19 21 70 71 74\n $ : int [1:6] 19 21 71 73 84 86\n $ : int [1:6] 6 32 50 53 55 69\n $ : int [1:6] 58 64 65 66 67 68\n $ : int [1:6] 18 23 38 61 62 63\n $ : int [1:6] 2 8 9 46 58 68\n $ : int [1:6] 38 40 41 43 44 45\n $ : int [1:6] 34 35 36 41 45 47\n $ : int [1:6] 25 26 28 33 39 42\n $ : int [1:6] 19 20 21 23 35 41\n $ : int [1:6] 12 13 15 16 22 63\n $ : int [1:6] 7 9 66 68 71 74\n $ : int [1:6] 2 3 4 5 56 69\n $ : int [1:6] 8 9 21 46 47 74\n $ : int [1:6] 59 60 61 62 63 88\n $ : int [1:6] 59 60 61 62 63 87\n - attr(*, \"region.id\")= chr [1:88] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n - attr(*, \"call\")= language knearneigh(x = coords, k = 6)\n - attr(*, \"sym\")= logi FALSE\n - attr(*, \"type\")= chr \"knn\"\n - attr(*, \"knn-k\")= num 6\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"nb\"\n\n\nThe distance weight matrix is then plotted.\n\nplot(hunan$geometry, border=\"lightgrey\")\nplot(knn6, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col = \"purple\")"

The nb21listw() (under spdep package) is used to convert a neighborhood object, wm_q, to a listw object, rswm_q (style=“W”) or rswm_ids (style=“B”). This allows row-standardised distance weight matrices to be created, whereby each row sums to 1.\nThe “style” argument influences the specific characteristics of the weights matrix.\nThe following example shows “style=”W””, each neighboring polygon is assigned equal weight. This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. While this is the most intuitive way to summarise the neighbors’ values, its downside is that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data.\n\nStudent Note:\n\n“listw” stands for list of weights.\nThe “style” argument set to “W” specifies a binary spatial weight matrix, where the presence of a spatial relationship is indicated by 1, and absence by 0. All neighbouring units are considered equal in terms of their impact on the target unit, reflecting a uniform spatial relationship.\nThe “zero.policy” argument returns lists of non-neighbours when set to TRUE.\n\n\n\nrswm_q = nb2listw(wm_q, style=\"W\", zero.policy = TRUE)\nrswm_q\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: W \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn S0       S1       S2\nW 88 7744 88 37.86334 365.9147\n\n\nThe weights of the first polygon’s eight neighbours are extracted below. It shows that each neighbour is assigned an equal weight of 0.2 of the total weight. This means that when computing the average neighbouring income values, each neighbour’s income will be multiplied by 0.2 before being tallied.\n\nStudent Note: In this example, each neighbour has an equal weight, indicating a form of uniform spatial relationship.\n\n\nrswm_q$weights[1]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2\n\n\nOn the other hand, for “style=”B””, the spatial lag of a variable for a particular unit is the sum of that variable over all neighbouring units, with each neighbour contributing a binary indicator (1 or 0).\n\nStudent Note:\n\n“glist=ids” means the list of inverse distances is used for the general list of weights argument.\nThe “style” argument set to “B” specifies a binary spatial lag matrix, where the presence of a spatial relationship is indicated by 1, and absence by 0. At the same time, the direction of the connection is considered for the calculations.\n\n\n\nrswm_ids = nb2listw(wm_q, glist=ids, style=\"B\", zero.policy=TRUE)\nrswm_ids\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn       S0        S1     S2\nB 88 7744 8.786867 0.3776535 3.8137\n\n\nThe weights of the first polygon’s five neighbours are extracted below.

    "text": "Four different spatial lagged variables are created to compute the average neighbour GDP per capita for each polygon.\n\nSpatial lag with row-standardized weights;\nSpatial lag as a sum of neighbouring values;\nSpatial window average; and\nSpatial window sum.\n\n\n\n\nStudent Note: Spatial lag with row-standardized weights reflects average value of the variable in neighbouring units, with closer units having a higher influence. It is calculated using the weighted average of the values of a variable in neighbouring units, where the weights are row standardised.\n\nComparing the outcome below with the neighbouring GDP per capita values found in section 8.5.1 above, it is observed that each element GDPPC.lag is the average GDP per capita value of the neighbouring polygons.

It includes the codes used, the graphs obtained as well as the insights gathered.\n\n\n\nThe following data sets were used in this hands-on exercise:\n\nMaster Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web) from data.gov.sg\nPre-Schools Location from data.gov.sg\nCycling Path from LTADataMall\nLatest version of Singapore Airbnb listing data from Inside Airbnb\n\nThe data sets were placed under two sub-folders:\n\ngeospatial (Master Plan Subzone Boundary, Pre-Schools Location, and Cycling Path), and\naspatial (Airbnb Listing).\n\nThese two sub-folders are within the data folder of my Hands-on_Ex1A folder.\n\n\n\nThe two R packages used in this hands-on exercise are:\n\nsf for importing, managing, and processing geospatial data; and\ntidyverse for performing data science tasks such as importing, wrangling, and visualising data.\n\nThey are loaded into the R environment using the following code:\n\npacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse)\n\nStudent Note: This allows for loading of multiple packages in one line of code.\n\n\n\nThe st_read() (under sf package) is used to import the three geospatial data sets:\n\nMP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL, a polygon feature layer in ESRI shapefile format;\nCyclingPath, a line feature layer in ESRI shapefile format; and\nPreSchool, a point feature layer in kml file format.\n\n\n\nThe MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL data set was imported into R as a polygon feature data frame using st_read().\n\nmpsz = st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\", \n               layer = \"MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL\")\n\nReading layer `MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL' from data source \n  `C:\\jmphosis\\ISSS624\\Hands-on_Ex\\Hands-on_Ex1A\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 323 features and 15 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2667.538 ymin: 15748.72 xmax: 56396.44 ymax: 50256.33\nProjected CRS: SVY21\n\n\nStudent Note: The geospatial objects are multipolygon features.

    "text": "Note: This Hands-on Exercise 2B combines both 9 Global Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation and 10 Local Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation on r4gdsa.netlify.app since there are some overlaps in Sections 9.1 to 9.5.\n\n\nIn this page, I show how I had completed the Hands-on Exercise 2B, on computing Global and Local Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation (GLSA) using the spdep package.\nThe objectives are:\n\nImport geospatial data using appropriate function(s) of sf package;\nImport csv file using appropriate function of readr package;\nPerform relational join using appropriate join function of dplyr package;\nCompute Global Spatial Autocorrelation (GSA) statistics using appropriate functions of spdep package, including:\n\nPlot Moran scatterplot,\nCompute and plot spatial correlogram.\n\nCompute Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) statistics for detecting clusters and outliers using appropriate functions spdep package;\nCompute Getis-Ord’s Gi statistics for detecting hot spot or/and cold spot area using appropriate functions of spdep package; and\nVisualise the analysis output using tmap package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn spatial policy, one of the main development objective of the local government and planners is to ensure equal distribution of development in the province.\nHence, the appropriate spatial statistical methods are applied to study:\n\nIs development evenly distributed geographically?\nIf no, is there sign of spatial clustering? If yes, where are these clusters?\n\nFor this hands-on exercise, the GDP per capita (as a development indicator) of Hunan province in China is studied.\n\n\n\nThe following data sets are used in this hands-on exercise:\n\nHunan’s County Boundary Layer. This is a geospatial data set in ESRI shapefile format.\nHunan’s Local Development Indicators 2012. This csv file contains data on selected Hunan’s local development indicators in 2012.\n\nThe data sets are placed under two sub-folders:\n\ngeospatial (County Boundary Layer), and\naspatial (Local Development Indicators 2012).\n\nThese two sub-folders are within the data folder of my Hands-on_Ex2 folder.\n\n\n\nThe R packages used in this hands-on exercises are:\n\ntmap for thematic mapping;\nsf for importing, managing, and processing geospatial data;\ntidyverse (i.e. readr, tidyr, dplyr) for performing data science tasks such as importing, tidying, and wrangling data; and\nspdep for analysing spatial dependence and spatial relationships in data.\n\nThey are loaded into the R environment using the following code:\n\npacman::p_load(sf, spdep, tmap, tidyverse)\n\nStudent Note: This allows for loading of multiple packages in one line of code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe st_read() (under sf package) is used to import the geospatial data set: hunan, a polygon feature layer in ESRI shapefile format.\nStudent Note: The geospatial objects are polygon features. There are a total of 88 features and 7 fields in hunan simple feature data frame. hunan is in wgs84 coordinate system.\n\nhunan = st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\", \n                 layer = \"Hunan\")\n\nReading layer `Hunan' from data source \n  `C:\\jmphosis\\ISSS624\\Hands-on_Ex\\Hands-on_Ex2\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 88 features and 7 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 108.7831 ymin: 24.6342 xmax: 114.2544 ymax: 30.12812\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\n\n\n\nThe read_csv() (under readr package) is used to import the aspatial data set: hunan_2012, a csv file.\nStudent Note: The hunan_2012 tibble data frame contains 88 rows and 29 columns. There are two columns with character data - County and City.\n\nhunan2012 = read_csv(\"data/aspatial/Hunan_2012.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nThe attribute table of the spatial polygons data frame, hunan, is updated using the attribute fields of the tibble data frame, hunan2012 using left_join() (under dplyr package).\nStudent Note: Without explicitly stating the “by” argument for left_join(), the two tables are joined by the ‘County’ columns.\n\nhunan = left_join(hunan,hunan2012) %&gt;%\n  select(1:4, 7, 15)\n\nhunan\n\nSimple feature collection with 88 features and 6 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 108.7831 ymin: 24.6342 xmax: 114.2544 ymax: 30.12812\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\nFirst 10 features:\n     NAME_2  ID_3    NAME_3   ENGTYPE_3    County GDPPC\n1   Changde 21098   Anxiang      County   Anxiang 23667\n2   Changde 21100   Hanshou      County   Hanshou 20981\n3   Changde 21101    Jinshi County City    Jinshi 34592\n4   Changde 21102        Li      County        Li 24473\n5   Changde 21103     Linli      County     Linli 25554\n6   Changde 21104    Shimen      County    Shimen 27137\n7  Changsha 21109   Liuyang County City   Liuyang 63118\n8  Changsha 21110 Ningxiang      County Ningxiang 62202\n9  Changsha 21111 Wangcheng      County Wangcheng 70666\n10 Chenzhou 21112     Anren      County     Anren 12761\n                         geometry\n1  POLYGON ((112.0625 29.75523...\n2  POLYGON ((112.2288 29.11684...\n3  POLYGON ((111.8927 29.6013,...\n4  POLYGON ((111.3731 29.94649...\n5  POLYGON ((111.6324 29.76288...\n6  POLYGON ((110.8825 30.11675...\n7  POLYGON ((113.9905 28.5682,...\n8  POLYGON ((112.7181 28.38299...\n9  POLYGON ((112.7914 28.52688...\n10 POLYGON ((113.1757 26.82734...\n\n\n\n\n\nA basemap and a choropleth map are prepared usign qtm() (under tmap package) to visualise the 2012 Gross Domestic Product Per Capita (GDPPC).\nStudent Note: The two different styles used are “equal” and “quantile”. The equal style shows that high GDPPC (in absolute terms) is concentrated in a few counties in the northeast region. The quantile style shows that the top 50% of counties in terms of GDPPC are mainly on the east side of Hunan.\n\nequal = tm_shape(hunan) +\n  tm_fill(\"GDPPC\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"equal\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Equal interval classification\")\n\nquantile = tm_shape(hunan) +\n  tm_fill(\"GDPPC\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Equal quantile classification\")\n\ntmap_arrange(equal, \n             quantile, \n             asp=1, \n             ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Global Spatial Autocorrelation (GSA) statistics are computed for the study area. Also, Spatial Complete Randomness (SCR) test for GSA is performed.\n\nStudent Note: The SCR test for GSR checks if the spatial distribution of GDPPC is entirely random and lacks any systematic spatial pattern. In other words, it assesses whether the observed spatial pattern of the GDPPC deviates significantly from what would be expected under spatial randomness.\n\n\n\nFirstly, the spatial weights of the study area would need to be computed to define the neighbourhood relationships between the geographical units (i.e., county) in the study area.\nThe poly2nb() (under spdep package) is used to compute contiguity weight matrices for the study area. This function builds a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries.\nThe “queen” argument in the function is set to either TRUE (default) or FALSE. The TRUE option will return a list of first order neighbours using the Queen’s continguity criteria.\n\nStudent Note: According to Queen’s criteria, two regions are considered neighbours if they share any part of their boundary (even if it is a single point). This results in a more inclusive definition of neighbour relationships.\n\n\nStudent Note: The summary report below shows that there are 88 area units in hunan. The most connected area unit (85) has 11 neighbours. The least connected area units (30 and 65) have only one neighbour each.\n\n\nwm_q = poly2nb(hunan, queen = TRUE)\n\nsummary(wm_q)\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 11 \n 2  2 12 16 24 14 11  4  2  1 \n2 least connected regions:\n30 65 with 1 link\n1 most connected region:\n85 with 11 links\n\n\n\n\n\nWeights are assigned to each neighbouring polygon. The nb21listw() (under spdep package) is used to convert a neighborhood object, wm_q, to a listw object, rswm_q (style=“W”). This allows row-standardised distance weight matrices to be created, whereby each row sums to 1. The “style” argument influences the specific characteristics of the weights matrix.\nFor this hands-on exercise, the “style=”W”” is used, each neighboring polygon is assigned equal weight. This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. While this is the most intuitive way to summarise the neighbors’ values, its downside is that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data.\n\nStudent Note:\n\nThe “style” argument set to “W” specifies a binary spatial weight matrix, where the presence of a spatial relationship is indicated by 1, and absence by 0. All neighbouring units are considered equal in terms of their impact on the target unit, reflecting a uniform spatial relation\n\nB is the basic binary coding.\nC is globally standardised (sums over all links to n).\nU is equal to C divided by the number of neighbours (sums over all links to unity).\nS is the variance-stabilizing coding scheme proposed by Tiefelsdorf et al. 1999 (sums over all links to n).\n\nThe “zero.policy” argument returns lists of non-neighbours when set to TRUE. It means that weight vectors of zero length are inserted for regions without neighbour in the neighbours list. This in turn generates lag values of zero, equivalent to the sum of products of the zero row t(rep(0, length=length(neighbours))) %*% x, for arbitrary numerical vector x of length equal to the number of neighbours. The spatially lagged value of x for the zero-neighbour region will then be zero.\n\nThis ensures that even regions without neighbors are included in the spatial weights matrix, and their spatial lag values are explicitly set to zero. This can be useful in certain analytical contexts where the treatment of regions without neighbours is important for the analysis.\n\n\n\n\nrswm_q = nb2listw(wm_q,\n                  style=\"W\",\n                  zero.policy = TRUE)\nrswm_q\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: W \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn S0       S1       S2\nW 88 7744 88 37.86334 365.9147\n\n\n\n\n\nMoran’s I statistics testing is performed using moran.test() (under spdep package) to study the GSA.\n\nQuestion: What statistical conclusion can be drawn from the output below?\nAnswer:\n\nThe Moran’s I statistic of 0.300749970 suggests a positive spatial autocorrelation in the GDPPC variable.\nThe p-value of 1.095e-06 is very small, indicating a strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis of spatial randomness and support the alternative hypothesis.\nThe alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant positive autocorrelation in the GDPPC, i.e., neighbouring regions tend to have similar GDPPC values (cluster together).\n\n\n\nmoran.test(hunan$GDPPC, \n           listw = rswm_q, \n           zero.policy = TRUE, \n           na.action=na.omit)\n\n\n    Moran I test under randomisation\n\ndata:  hunan$GDPPC  \nweights: rswm_q    \n\nMoran I statistic standard deviate = 4.7351, p-value = 1.095e-06\nalternative hypothesis: greater\nsample estimates:\nMoran I statistic       Expectation          Variance \n      0.300749970      -0.011494253       0.004348351 \n\n\n\n\nA permutation test (999 simulations using Monte Carlo) for Moran’s I statistic is performed using moran.mc() (under spdep package).\n\nStudent Note:\n\nThe set.seed() is used to ensure reproducibility.\nThe “na.action = na.omit” argument specifies the action to be taken if there are missing values.

They show how correlated pairs of spatial observations are when the distance (lag) between them is increased. They are plots of some index of autocorrelation (Moran’s I or Geary’s c) against distance.\nAlthough correlograms are not as fundamental as variograms (a keystone concept of geostatistics), they are very useful as an exploratory and descriptive tool. For this purpose they actually provide richer information than variograms.\n\n\nThe sp.correlogram() (under spdep package) is used to compute a 6-lag spatial correlogram of the GDPPC variable. The GSA used is Moran’s I. The output is plotted using plot() (under graphics package).\n\nStudent Note: The “method=”I”” argument specifies that Moran’s I should be used as the measure of spatial autocorrelation.\n\n\nQuestion: What statistical observation can be drawn from the plot below?\nAnswer:\n\nMoran’s I estimates are positive at shorter distance lags (distance lags 1-4). The positive values suggest that neighbouring regions tend to have similar GDPPC values (cluster together).\nMoran’s I estimates are negative at longer distance lags (distance lags 5-6). The negative values suggest that regions further away have dissimilar GDPPC values.\nThe p-values are generally very small (except for distance lag 4), indicating statistical significance, and high level of confidence to reject the null hypothesis of spatial randomness.\nOverall, statistical significance observed for positive correlation at distance lags of 1-3, and negative correlation at distance lags of 5-6.\n\n\n\nMI_corr = sp.correlogram(wm_q, \n                          hunan$GDPPC, \n                          order=6, \n                          method=\"I\", \n                          style=\"W\")\nplot(MI_corr)\n\n\n\n\nBy plotting the output might not allow us to provide complete interpretation.

The top right corner belongs to areas that have high GDPPC and are surrounded by other areas that have the average level of GDPPC.

Based on the local Moran’s I p-values, they are statistically significant.\nThere are some high-high GDPPC counties in the northeast region. Based on the local Moran’s I p-values, they are statistically significant.\nThere are also two counties with low-high GDPPC in the northeast region.

It looks at neighbours within a defined proximity to identify where either high or low values clutser spatially. Here, statistically significant hot spots are recognised as areas of high values where other areas within a neighbourhood range also share high values too.\nThe analysis consists of three steps:\n\nDeriving spatial weight matrix;\nComputing Gi statistics; and\nMapping Gi statistics.\n\n\n\n\nA new set of neighbours has to be defined. For Getis-Ord, neighbours are defined based on distance (as opposed to shared borders under spatial autocorrelation).\nThere are two types of distance-based proximity matrix:\n\nFixed distance weight matrix; and\nAdaptive distance weight matrix.\n\n\n\nBefore making a connectivity graph, points are required to associate with each polygon\nThe mapping function, map_dbl() (under the purrr package) is utilised to apply a function, st_centroid() (under sf package), on each element of the geometry column, us.bound, returning a vector of a same length.\nThe longitude is then extracted by looking for the first value of each centroid, while the latitude is extracted by looking for the second value of each centroid. The cbind() is then used to put the two values together.\n\nlongitude = map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])\n\nlatitude = map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])\n\ncoords = cbind(longitude, latitude)\n\n\n\n\nThe upper limit for the distance band is determined by using the following steps and functions under the spdep package:\n\nReturn a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours (knn) of each other by using knearneigh().\n\nStudent Note: In the matrix, each row corresponds to a point, and the columns contain the indices of its knn.\n\nConvert the knn object into a neighbours list of class nb with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids by using knn2nb().\nReturn the length of neighbour relationship edges by using nbdists(). This function returns in the units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, and in km otherwise.\nRemove the list structure of the returned object by using unlist() (under base package).\n\nThe summary report below shows that the largest first nearest neighbour distance is 61.79 km (i.e., max value). Thus, this is used as the upper threshold as it ensures that all units will have at least one neighbour.\n\nk1 = knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))  \nk1dists = unlist(nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = TRUE))  \nsummary(k1dists)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Having many neighbours smoothes the neighbour relationship across more neighbours.\nIt is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using k-nearest neighbours, either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry as shown below.\n\nknn = knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=8)) \nknn\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 704 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 9.090909 \nAverage number of links: 8 \nNon-symmetric neighbours list\n\n\nAgain, the nb2listw() (under spdep package) is used to convert the nb object into spatial weights object, knn_lw.\n\nknn_lw = nb2listw(knn, style = 'B')\nsummary(knn_lw)\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 704 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 9.090909 \nAverage number of links: 8 \nNon-symmetric neighbours list\nLink number distribution:\n\n 8 \n88 \n88 least connected regions:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 with 8 links\n88 most connected regions:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 with 8 links\n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn  S0   S1    S2\nB 88 7744 704 1300 23014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output of localG() (under spdep package) is a vector of G or Gstar values, with attributes “gstari” set to TRUE or FALSE, “call” set to the function call, and class “localG”.\nThe Gi statistics is represented as a Z-score. Greater values represent a greater intensity of clustering and the direction (positive or negative) indicates high or low clusters.\nThe Gi values for GDPPC 2012 is computed using fixed distance

The output vector, gi.adaptive, is converted into into an r matrix object using as.matrix() (under base package). Then, cbind() (under base package) is used to join hunan sf dataframe and gi.adaptive matrix to produce a new SpatialPolygonDataFrame, hunan.gi_adaptive. Lastly, the field name of gi value is renamed to gstat_fixed using rename() (under dplyr package).\n\nfips = order(hunan$County)\ngi.adaptive = localG(hunan$GDPPC, knn_lw)\n\nhunan.gi_adaptive = cbind(hunan, as.matrix(gi.adaptive)) %&gt;%\n  rename(gstat_adaptive = as.matrix.gi.adaptive.)\n\nThe Gi values derived using adaptive distance weight matrix are then plotted side by side with the GDPPC values in hunan using the tmap package.\n\nQuestion: What statistical observation can be drawn from the Gi map below?\nAnswer: The Gi values show a more graduated change from the northeast region to the central-west region, from positive to negative values. However, similar to fixed distance weights, the adaptive distance weights output also indicates High-High clustering in the northeast, and Low-Low clustering in the central-west.\n\n\ngdppc = qtm(hunan, \"GDPPC\")\n\nGimap_adaptive = tm_shape(hunan.gi_adaptive) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"gstat_adaptive\", \n          style = \"pretty\", \n          palette=\"-RdBu\", \n          title = \"local Gi\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\ntmap_arrange(gdppc, \n             Gimap_adaptive, \n             asp=1, \n             ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Note: On choosing between fixed distance weights and adaptive distance weights for GDPPC across counties in Hunan province, the latter may be more appropriate given that GDPPC appears to be more concentrated in the northeast region, which includes the provincial capital, Changsha, and the surrounding counties. Also, it is unlikely that the spatial processes influencing GDPPC are uniform across the entire study area since local development is affected by more than just distance from the provincial capital. Factors such as physical landscape (mountains, rivers), transport networks as well as socioeconomic policies (e.g., education, tourism) are not evenly developed throughout a province. Hence, an adaptive distance weights approach reflects the varying influence of different factors across space, and allows the analysis to capture the nuanced geospatial processes affecting GDPPC.\n\n~~~ End of Hands-on Exercise 2B ~~~"

    "text": "The Global Spatial Autocorrelation (GSA) statistics are computed for the study area. Also, Spatial Complete Randomness (SCR) test for GSA is performed.\n\nStudent Note: The SCR test for GSR checks if the spatial distribution of GDPPC is entirely random and lacks any systematic spatial pattern. In other words, it assesses whether the observed spatial pattern of the GDPPC deviates significantly from what would be expected under spatial randomness.\n\n\n\nFirstly, the spatial weights of the study area would need to be computed to define the neighbourhood relationships between the geographical units (i.e., county) in the study area.\nThe poly2nb() (under spdep package) is used to compute contiguity weight matrices for the study area. This function builds a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries.\nThe “queen” argument in the function is set to either TRUE (default) or FALSE. The TRUE option will return a list of first order neighbours using the Queen’s continguity criteria.\n\nStudent Note: According to Queen’s criteria, two regions are considered neighbours if they share any part of their boundary (even if it is a single point). This results in a more inclusive definition of neighbour relationships.\n\n\nStudent Note: The summary report below shows that there are 88 area units in hunan. The most connected area unit (85) has 11 neighbours. The least connected area units (30 and 65) have only one neighbour each.\n\n\nwm_q = poly2nb(hunan, queen = TRUE)\n\nsummary(wm_q)\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 11 \n 2  2 12 16 24 14 11  4  2  1 \n2 least connected regions:\n30 65 with 1 link\n1 most connected region:\n85 with 11 links\n\n\n\n\n\nWeights are assigned to each neighbouring polygon. The nb21listw() (under spdep package) is used to convert a neighborhood object, wm_q, to a listw object, rswm_q (style=“W”). This allows row-standardised distance weight matrices to be created, whereby each row sums to 1. The “style” argument influences the specific characteristics of the weights matrix.\nFor this hands-on exercise, the “style=”W”” is used, each neighboring polygon is assigned equal weight. This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. While this is the most intuitive way to summarise the neighbors’ values, its downside is that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data.\n\nStudent Note:\n\nThe “style” argument set to “W” specifies a binary spatial weight matrix, where the presence of a spatial relationship is indicated by 1, and absence by 0. All neighbouring units are considered equal in terms of their impact on the target unit, reflecting a uniform spatial relation\n\nB is the basic binary coding.\nC is globally standardised (sums over all links to n).\nU is equal to C divided by the number of neighbours (sums over all links to unity).\nS is the variance-stabilizing coding scheme proposed by Tiefelsdorf et al. 1999 (sums over all links to n).\n\nThe “zero.policy” argument returns lists of non-neighbours when set to TRUE. It means that weight vectors of zero length are inserted for regions without neighbour in the neighbours list. This in turn generates lag values of zero, equivalent to the sum of products of the zero row t(rep(0, length=length(neighbours))) %*% x, for arbitrary numerical vector x of length equal to the number of neighbours. The spatially lagged value of x for the zero-neighbour region will then be zero.\n\nThis ensures that even regions without neighbors are included in the spatial weights matrix, and their spatial lag values are explicitly set to zero.

    "text": "Spatial correlograms are great to examine patterns of spatial autocorrelation in the data or model residuals. They show how correlated pairs of spatial observations are when the distance (lag) between them is increased. They are plots of some index of autocorrelation (Moran’s I or Geary’s c) against distance.\nAlthough correlograms are not as fundamental as variograms (a keystone concept of geostatistics), they are very useful as an exploratory and descriptive tool. For this purpose they actually provide richer information than variograms.\n\n\nThe sp.correlogram() (under spdep package) is used to compute a 6-lag spatial correlogram of the GDPPC variable. The GSA used is Moran’s I. The output is plotted using plot() (under graphics package).\n\nStudent Note: The “method=”I”” argument specifies that Moran’s I should be used as the measure of spatial autocorrelation.\n\n\nQuestion: What statistical observation can be drawn from the plot below?\nAnswer:\n\nMoran’s I estimates are positive at shorter distance lags (distance lags 1-4). The positive values suggest that neighbouring regions tend to have similar GDPPC values (cluster together).\nMoran’s I estimates are negative at longer distance lags (distance lags 5-6). The negative values suggest that regions further away have dissimilar GDPPC values.\nThe p-values are generally very small (except for distance lag 4), indicating statistical significance, and high level of confidence to reject the null hypothesis of spatial randomness.\nOverall, statistical significance observed for positive correlation at distance lags of 1-3, and negative correlation at distance lags of 5-6.\n\n\n\nMI_corr = sp.correlogram(wm_q, \n                          hunan$GDPPC, \n                          order=6, \n                          method=\"I\", \n                          style=\"W\")\nplot(MI_corr)\n\n\n\n\nBy plotting the output might not allow us to provide complete interpretation.

    "text": "The LISA Cluster Map shows the significant locations that are colour coded by the type of spatial autocorrelation.\nBefore generating the LISA cluster map, the Moran scatterplot is plotted.\n\n\nThe moran.plot() (under spdep package) is used to plot the Moran scatterplot, which is an illustration of the relationship between the values of the chosen attribute at each location and the average value of the same attribute at neighboring locations.\nThe plot is split in 4 quadrants. The top right corner belongs to areas that have high GDPPC and are surrounded by other areas that have the average level of GDPPC. These are the high-high locations.\n\nnci = moran.plot(hunan$GDPPC, rswm_q,\n                  labels=as.character(hunan$County), \n                  xlab=\"GDPPC 2012\", \n                  ylab=\"Spatially Lag GDPPC 2012\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scale() (from base package) is used to center and scale the variable. Centering is done by subtracting the mean (omitting NAs) of the corresponding columns, and scaling is done by dividing the (centered) variable by their standard deviations.\nThe as.vector() (under base package) is added to make sure that the data type derived is a vector that maps neatly into the dataframe.\n\nhunan$Z.GDPPC = scale(hunan$GDPPC) %&gt;% \n  as.vector\n\nhead(hunan)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 7 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 110.4922 ymin: 28.61762 xmax: 112.3013 ymax: 30.12812\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n   NAME_2  ID_3  NAME_3   ENGTYPE_3  County GDPPC\n1 Changde 21098 Anxiang      County Anxiang 23667\n2 Changde 21100 Hanshou      County Hanshou 20981\n3 Changde 21101  Jinshi County City  Jinshi 34592\n4 Changde 21102      Li      County      Li 24473\n5 Changde 21103   Linli      County   Linli 25554\n6 Changde 21104  Shimen      County  Shimen 27137\n                        geometry      Z.GDPPC\n1 POLYGON ((112.0625 29.75523... -0.049205949\n2 POLYGON ((112.2288 29.11684... -0.228341158\n3 POLYGON ((111.8927 29.6013,...  0.679406172\n4 POLYGON ((111.3731 29.94649...  0.004547952\n5 POLYGON ((111.6324 29.76288...  0.076642204\n6 POLYGON ((110.8825 30.11675...  0.182215933\n\n\nThe Moran scatterplot is then plotted again.\n\nnci2 = moran.plot(hunan$Z.GDPPC, rswm_q,\n                   labels=as.character(hunan$County),\n                   xlab=\"z-GDPPC 2012\", \n                   ylab=\"Spatially Lag z-GDPPC 2012\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo plot a LISA cluster map, the following steps are taken:\n\nThe spatially lagged variable of interest (GDPPC) is derived and centered around its mean.\nThe local Moran’s I is centered around the mean.\nThe statistical significance level for the local Moran’s I is set at 0.05.\nThe four quadrants are then defined.\nNon-significant Moran’s I are then placed in the category 0.\n\n\nquadrant = vector(mode=\"numeric\",length=nrow(localMI))\n\nhunan$lag_GDPPC = lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)\n\nDV = hunan$lag_GDPPC - mean(hunan$lag_GDPPC)    \n\nLM_I = localMI[,1]\n\nsignif = 0.05       \n\nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] = 1\nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] = 2\nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] = 3  \nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] = 4    \nquadrant[localMI[,5]&gt;signif] = 0\n\nThe LISA map is then plotted.\n\nhunan.localMI$quadrant = quadrant\ncolors = c(\"#ffffff\", \"#2c7bb6\", \"#abd9e9\", \"#fdae61\", \"#d7191c\")\nclusters = c(\"insignificant\", \"low-low\", \"low-high\", \"high-low\", \"high-high\")\n\ntm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"quadrant\", \n          style = \"cat\", \n          palette = colors[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1], \n          labels = clusters[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1],\n          popup.vars = c(\"\")) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,17)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\nFor effective interpretation, both the local Moran’s I values map and its corresponding p-values map are plotted side by side.\n\nQuestion: What statistical observations can be drawn from the LISA map below?\nAnswer:\n\nMost of the Moran’s I values are insignificant.\nThere are two low-low GDPPC counties in the central-west region. Based on the local Moran’s I p-values, they are statistically significant.\nThere are some high-high GDPPC counties in the northeast region. Based on the local Moran’s I p-values, they are statistically significant.\nThere are also two counties with low-high GDPPC in the northeast region.

    "text": "Beside detecting cluster and outliers, localised spatial statistics can be also used to detect hot spot and/or cold spot areas.\nThe term ‘hot spot’ has been used generically across disciplines to describe a region or value that is higher relative to its surroundings (Lepers et al 2005, Aben et al 2012, Isobe et al 2015).\n\n\nAn alternative spatial statistics to detect spatial anomalies is the Getis and Ord’s G-statistics (Getis and Ord, 1972; Ord and Getis, 1995). It looks at neighbours within a defined proximity to identify where either high or low values clutser spatially. Here, statistically significant hot spots are recognised as areas of high values where other areas within a neighbourhood range also share high values too.\nThe analysis consists of three steps:\n\nDeriving spatial weight matrix;\nComputing Gi statistics; and\nMapping Gi statistics.\n\n\n\n\nA new set of neighbours has to be defined. For Getis-Ord, neighbours are defined based on distance (as opposed to shared borders under spatial autocorrelation).\nThere are two types of distance-based proximity matrix:\n\nFixed distance weight matrix; and\nAdaptive distance weight matrix.\n\n\n\nBefore making a connectivity graph, points are required to associate with each polygon\nThe mapping function, map_dbl() (under the purrr package) is utilised to apply a function, st_centroid() (under sf package), on each element of the geometry column, us.bound, returning a vector of a same length.\nThe longitude is then extracted by looking for the first value of each centroid, while the latitude is extracted by looking for the second value of each centroid. The cbind() is then used to put the two values together.\n\nlongitude = map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])\n\nlatitude = map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])\n\ncoords = cbind(longitude, latitude)\n\n\n\n\nThe upper limit for the distance band is determined by using the following steps and functions under the spdep package:\n\nReturn a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours (knn) of each other by using knearneigh().\n\nStudent Note: In the matrix, each row corresponds to a point, and the columns contain the indices of its knn.\n\nConvert the knn object into a neighbours list of class nb with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids by using knn2nb().\nReturn the length of neighbour relationship edges by using nbdists(). This function returns in the units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, and in km otherwise.\nRemove the list structure of the returned object by using unlist() (under base package).\n\nThe summary report below shows that the largest first nearest neighbour distance is 61.79 km (i.e., max value). Thus, this is used as the upper threshold as it ensures that all units will have at least one neighbour.\n\nk1 = knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))  \nk1dists = unlist(nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = TRUE))  \nsummary(k1dists)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Max. \n  24.79   32.57   38.01   39.07   44.52   61.79 \n\n\n\n\n\nThe dnearneigh() (under spdep package) is used to compute the distance weight matrix.\n\nStudent Note: knearneigh() computes knn, while dnearneigh() computes distance-based neighbours.\n\n\nwm_d62 = dnearneigh(coords, 0, 62, longlat = TRUE) \nwm_d62\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 324 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 4.183884 \nAverage number of links: 3.681818 \n\n\nThe nb2listw() (under spdep package) is then used to convert the nb object into spatial weights object, wm62_lw.\n\nwm62_lw = nb2listw(wm_d62, style = 'B')\nsummary(wm62_lw)\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 324 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 4.183884 \nAverage number of links: 3.681818 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6 \n 6 15 14 26 20  7 \n6 least connected regions:\n6 15 30 32 56 65 with 1 link\n7 most connected regions:\n21 28 35 45 50 52 82 with 6 links\n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn  S0  S1   S2\nB 88 7744 324 648 5440\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the characteristics of fixed distance weight matrix is that more densely settled areas (usually the urban areas) tend to have more neighbours and the less densely settled areas (usually the rural counties) tend to have lesser neighbours. Having many neighbours smoothes the neighbour relationship across more neighbours.\nIt is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using k-nearest neighbours, either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry as shown below.\n\nknn = knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=8)) \nknn\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 704 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 9.090909 \nAverage number of links: 8 \nNon-symmetric neighbours list\n\n\nAgain, the nb2listw() (under spdep package) is used to convert the nb object into spatial weights object, knn_lw.\n\nknn_lw = nb2listw(knn, style = 'B')\nsummary(knn_lw)\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 704 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 9.090909 \nAverage number of links: 8 \nNon-symmetric neighbours list\nLink number distribution:\n\n 8 \n88 \n88 least connected regions:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 with 8 links\n88 most connected regions:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 with 8 links\n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn  S0   S1    S2\nB 88 7744 704 1300 23014"

Small p-values (typically below 0.05) suggest that the observed clustering or dispersion is unlikely to have occurred by random chance.\nCluster Identification (attr(,“cluster”)) categorises each observation as either “Low” or “High” based on the local spatial autocorrelation pattern.\n\n“Low” indicates observations that are part of a Low-Low or High-High cluster.\n“High” indicates observations that are part of a High-Low or Low-High cluster.\n\nAttribute Information (attr(,“gstari”)) is set to FALSE, indicating that the analysis was not run under a global model.\n\nIf set to TRUE, it would mean that the observation contributes to the global spatial autocorrelation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gi values for GDPPC 2012 is computed using adaptive distance weights, knn_lw.\nThe Gi values are then joined to their corresponding hunan sf dataframe. The output vector, gi.adaptive, is converted into into an r matrix object using as.matrix() (under base package). Then, cbind() (under base package) is used to join hunan sf dataframe and gi.adaptive matrix to produce a new SpatialPolygonDataFrame, hunan.gi_adaptive. Lastly, the field name of gi value is renamed to gstat_fixed using rename() (under dplyr package).\n\nfips = order(hunan$County)\ngi.adaptive = localG(hunan$GDPPC, knn_lw)\n\nhunan.gi_adaptive = cbind(hunan, as.matrix(gi.adaptive)) %&gt;%\n  rename(gstat_adaptive = as.matrix.gi.adaptive.)\n\nThe Gi values derived using adaptive distance weight matrix are then plotted side by side with the GDPPC values in hunan using the tmap package.\n\nQuestion: What statistical observation can be drawn from the Gi map below?\nAnswer: The Gi values show a more graduated change from the northeast region to the central-west region, from positive to negative values. However, similar to fixed distance weights, the adaptive distance weights output also indicates High-High clustering in the northeast, and Low-Low clustering in the central-west.\n\n\ngdppc = qtm(hunan, \"GDPPC\")\n\nGimap_adaptive = tm_shape(hunan.gi_adaptive) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"gstat_adaptive\", \n          style = \"pretty\", \n          palette=\"-RdBu\", \n          title = \"local Gi\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\ntmap_arrange(gdppc, \n             Gimap_adaptive, \n             asp=1, \n             ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Note: On choosing between fixed distance weights and adaptive distance weights for GDPPC across counties in Hunan province, the latter may be more appropriate given that GDPPC appears to be more concentrated in the northeast region, which includes the provincial capital, Changsha, and the surrounding counties. Also, it is unlikely that the spatial processes influencing GDPPC are uniform across the entire study area since local development is affected by more than just distance from the provincial capital. Factors such as physical landscape (mountains, rivers), transport networks as well as socioeconomic policies (e.g., education, tourism) are not evenly developed throughout a province. Hence, an adaptive distance weights approach reflects the varying influence of different factors across space, and allows the analysis to capture the nuanced geospatial processes affecting GDPPC.\n\n~~~ End of Hands-on Exercise 2B ~~~"

    "text": "Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is a spatial statistical technique that takes non-stationary variables into consideration (e.g., climate, demographic factors, physical environment characteristics) and models the local relationships between these independent variables and an outcome of interest (also known as dependent variable).\nIn this hands-on exercise, hedonic pricing models are built using GWR methods. The dependent variable is the resale prices of condominium in 2015. The independent variables are divided into either structural or locational factors.\n\n\n\nThe two data sets used in this hand-on exercise are:\n\nURA Master Plan Subzone Boundary in shapefile format (i.e. MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL); and\n2015 Condo Resale Data in csv format (i.e. condo_resale_2015.csv).\n\n\n\n\nThe packages used in this hands-on exercise are:\n\nsf for spatial data handling;\ntidyverse for attribute data handling;\ntmap for choropleth mapping;\nggpubr for creating customised and annotated ggplot2 plots for better visualisation;\ncorrplot for multivariate data visualisation and analysis;\nspdep for analysing spatial dependence and spatial relationships in data;\nGWmodel for calibrating geographical weighted family of models;\nolsrr for building ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models and performing diagnostic tests; and\ngtsummary for creating publication-ready analytical and summary tables;\n\nThe packages are loaded into the R environment:\n\npacman::p_load(olsrr, corrplot, ggpubr, sf, spdep, GWmodel, tmap, tidyverse, gtsummary)\n\nGWModel Package\nThe GWmodel package provides a collection of localised spatial statistical methods, namely:\n\nGeographically weighted summary statistics,\nGeographically weighted principal components analysis,\nGeographically weighted discriminant analysis, and\nVarious forms of geographically weighted regression, some of which are provided in basic and robust (outlier resistant) forms.\n\nCommonly, outputs or parameters of the GWmodel are mapped to provide a useful exploratory tool, which can often precede (and direct) a more traditional or sophisticated statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe geospatial data used in this hands-on exercise is MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL.

It helps ensure that the spatial objects are in a valid state for plotting.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons() +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"SELLING_PRICE\",\n          alpha = 0.6,\n          style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tmap_mode() function with “plot” argument is used to turn the display into the plot mode.\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hedonic pricing models for condominium resale units are built using the lm() function in the stats package.\n\n\nA simple linear regression model is built using “SELLING_PRICE” as the dependent variable and “AREA_SQM” as the independent variable.\n\ncondo.slr = lm(formula=SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM, data = condo_resale.sf)\n\nThe lm() function returns an object of class “lm” or for multiple responses of class c(“mlm,”lm”).\nThe summary() function in the base package and the anova() in the stats package are used to obtain a summary and analysis of variance table of the results.

Hence, the null hypothesis of the B0 and B1 are equal to 0 will be rejected. As a result, it can be inferred that the B0 and B1 are good parameter estimates.\nThe ggplot() function is used to draw a scatterplot to visualise the best fit line using the lm() method.

If highly correlated independent variables are used in building a regression model, the quality of the model will be compromised. This phenomenon is known as multicollinearity in statistics.\nA correlation matrix is commonly used to visualise the relationships between the independent variables. Beside the pairs() function in the graphics package, there are many packages that support the display of a correlation matrix. In this hands-on exercise, the corrplot package will be used.\n\ncorrplot(cor(condo_resale[, 5:23]), diag = FALSE, order = \"AOE\",\n         tl.pos = \"td\", tl.cex = 0.5, method = \"number\", type = \"upper\")\n\n\n\n\nThe matrix reorder is very important for mining the hidden structure and pattern in the matrix. There are four methods in corrplot (parameter order), named “AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. In the code chunk above, “AOE” order is used. It orders the variables by using the angular order of the eigenvectors method. From the scatterplot matrix, it is clear that “Freehold” is highly correlated to “LEASE_99YEAR”.

The plot shows that most of the data points are scattered around the residual = 0 line. Hence, it can be concluded that the relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables are linear.\n\nols_plot_resid_fit(condo.mlr1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ols_plot_resid_hist() function of the olsrr package is used to perform the normality assumption test of the residuals.

Mapping the Local R2 values to see where GWR predicts well and where it predicts poorly may provide clues about important variables that may be missing from the regression model.\nPredicted: these are the estimated (or fitted) y values computed by GWR.\nResiduals: to obtain the residual values, the fitted y values are subtracted from the observed y values. Standardised residuals have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. A cold-to-hot rendered map of standardised residuals can be produced by using these values.\nCoefficient Standard Error: these values measure the reliability of each coefficient estimate. Confidence in those estimates are higher when standard errors are small in relation to the actual coefficient values. Large standard errors may indicate problems with local collinearity.\n\nThey are all stored in a SpatialPointsDataFrame or SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object integrated with fit.points, GWR coefficient estimates, y value, predicted values, coefficient standard errors and t-values in its \"data\" slot in an object called SDF of the output list.\n\n\n\nThe SDF is converted into a simple feature data frame to visualise its fields.\n\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive = st_as_sf(gwr.adaptive$SDF) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs=3414)\n\n\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21 = st_transform(condo_resale.sf.adaptive,

Each coefficient estimate has an associated standard error, and the t-value is calculated by dividing the coefficient estimate by its standard error. The resulting t-value is then compared to critical values from a t-distribution to assess whether the coefficient is statistically significant.\nIn general, if the t-value is large (far from zero), it suggests that the coefficient estimate is significantly different from zero. If the t-value is small, it suggests that the coefficient estimate is not significantly different from zero.\n\n\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\nAREA_SQM_SE = tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_SE\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nAREA_SQM_TV = tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_TV\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\ntmap_arrange(AREA_SQM_SE, AREA_SQM_TV, \n             asp=1, ncol=2,\n             sync = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGollini I, Lu B, Charlton M, Brunsdon C, Harris P (2015) “GWmodel: an R Package for exploring Spatial Heterogeneity using Geographically Weighted Models”.

The dependent variable is the resale prices of condominium in 2015. The independent variables are divided into either structural or locational factors."

    "text": "The hedonic pricing models for condominium resale units are built using the lm() function in the stats package.\n\n\nA simple linear regression model is built using “SELLING_PRICE” as the dependent variable and “AREA_SQM” as the independent variable.\n\ncondo.slr = lm(formula=SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM, data = condo_resale.sf)\n\nThe lm() function returns an object of class “lm” or for multiple responses of class c(“mlm,”lm”).\nThe summary() function in the base package and the anova() in the stats package are used to obtain a summary and analysis of variance table of the results.

Hence, the null hypothesis of the B0 and B1 are equal to 0 will be rejected. As a result, it can be inferred that the B0 and B1 are good parameter estimates.\nThe ggplot() function is used to draw a scatterplot to visualise the best fit line using the lm() method. There are a few statistical outliers with relatively high selling prices.\n\nggplot(data=condo_resale.sf,  \n       aes(x=`AREA_SQM`, y=`SELLING_PRICE`)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualising the Relationships of Independent Variables\nBefore building a multiple regression model, it is important to ensure that the indepdent variables used are not highly correlated to each other. If highly correlated independent variables are used in building a regression model, the quality of the model will be compromised. This phenomenon is known as multicollinearity in statistics.\nA correlation matrix is commonly used to visualise the relationships between the independent variables. Beside the pairs() function in the graphics package, there are many packages that support the display of a correlation matrix. In this hands-on exercise, the corrplot package will be used.\n\ncorrplot(cor(condo_resale[, 5:23]), diag = FALSE, order = \"AOE\",\n         tl.pos = \"td\", tl.cex = 0.5, method = \"number\", type = \"upper\")\n\n\n\n\nThe matrix reorder is very important for mining the hidden structure and pattern in the matrix. There are four methods in corrplot (parameter order), named “AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. In the code chunk above, “AOE” order is used. It orders the variables by using the angular order of the eigenvectors method. From the scatterplot matrix, it is clear that “Freehold” is highly correlated to “LEASE_99YEAR”.

The plot shows that most of the data points are scattered around the residual = 0 line. Hence, it can be concluded that the relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables are linear.\n\nols_plot_resid_fit(condo.mlr1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ols_plot_resid_hist() function of the olsrr package is used to perform the normality assumption test of the residuals.

Mapping the Local R2 values to see where GWR predicts well and where it predicts poorly may provide clues about important variables that may be missing from the regression model.\nPredicted: these are the estimated (or fitted) y values computed by GWR.\nResiduals: to obtain the residual values, the fitted y values are subtracted from the observed y values. Standardised residuals have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. A cold-to-hot rendered map of standardised residuals can be produced by using these values.\nCoefficient Standard Error: these values measure the reliability of each coefficient estimate. Confidence in those estimates are higher when standard errors are small in relation to the actual coefficient values. Large standard errors may indicate problems with local collinearity.\n\nThey are all stored in a SpatialPointsDataFrame or SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object integrated with fit.points, GWR coefficient estimates, y value, predicted values, coefficient standard errors and t-values in its \"data\" slot in an object called SDF of the output list.\n\n\n\nThe SDF is converted into a simple feature data frame to visualise its fields.\n\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive = st_as_sf(gwr.adaptive$SDF) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs=3414)\n\n\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21 = st_transform(condo_resale.sf.adaptive,

    "text": "The coefficient estimates are visualised using the functions in the tmap package.\n\nStudent Note: The standard error values and t-values for “AREA_SQM” are mapped below.\n\nIn the context of GWR, t-values are commonly associated with coefficient estimates. Each coefficient estimate has an associated standard error, and the t-value is calculated by dividing the coefficient estimate by its standard error. The resulting t-value is then compared to critical values from a t-distribution to assess whether the coefficient is statistically significant.\nIn general, if the t-value is large (far from zero), it suggests that the coefficient estimate is significantly different from zero. If the t-value is small, it suggests that the coefficient estimate is not significantly different from zero.\n\n\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\nAREA_SQM_SE = tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_SE\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nAREA_SQM_TV = tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_TV\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\ntmap_arrange(AREA_SQM_SE, AREA_SQM_TV, \n             asp=1, ncol=2,\n             sync = TRUE)"
